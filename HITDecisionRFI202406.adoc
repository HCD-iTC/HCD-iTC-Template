FCS_CKM.1/SKG Cryptographic Key Generation (Symmetric Keys)

// Provide the issue description extracted from the Issue that was generated for this problem, question, etc. that resulted in this TD being generated.
// Include the Issue Number
== Issue Description

The TSS assurance activity does not cover the selection of section 6.3 of NIST SP 800-133 Rev.2 in the FCS_CKM.1/SKG Cryptographic Key Generation (Symmetric Keys) SFR. 

// Provide the resolution agreed upon by the HIT for this Issue
== Resolution

Update the TSS assurance activity to cover the generation of symmetric keys by combining one or more keys and other data in accordance with section 6.3 of NIST SP 800-133 Rev.2. 


// Provide here the specific change(s) by Document, Section number, paragraph and line that is to be made to the HCD cPP and/or HCD SD to resolve this issue
== CPP_HCD_V1.0_supporting_doc

The SD is updated as follows (yellow highlights for additions, strikethrough for deletions) per section that is being updated:

*2.2.1.1. TSS*

The evaluator shall review the TSS to determine that it describes how the functionality described by
FCS_RBG_EXT.1 is invoked and how the TOE obtains a symmetric key through direct generation
from a random bit generator as specified in FCS_RBG_EXT.1 #or by combining one or more symmetric keys and other data#.

//Include a pointer to the file that contains the actual fix for this TD
