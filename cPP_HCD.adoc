== PP Introduction

=== PP Reference Identification
- PP Reference: {doctitle}

- PP Date: {revdate}

=== TOE Overview

The Target of Evaluation in this cPP is an HCD. HCDs support job functions to convert hardcopy documents into digital form (scanning), convert digital documents into hardcopy form (printing), duplicate hardcopy documents (copying), or transmit documents over a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connection (PSTN faxing). Hardcopy documents typically take the form of paper, but can take other forms (e.g. transparencies).

For the purpose of this cPP, a conforming HCD must support at least one of the job functions printing, scanning, or copying and must support the functions network communications and administration.

The job functions supported by the HCD and the network communications and administration functions are “Required Uses” of a conforming HCD and are mandatory functions. A conforming HCD may also support “Conditionally Mandatory Uses” as well as "Optional Uses". Conditionally Mandatory Uses are optional functions, the presence of which in a HCD is not required for conformance, but which must meet conditionally mandatory requirements if they are present in a HCD.  "Optional Uses" are optional functions that may, but need not, be evaluated.

=== TOE Design

==== Boundary of the TOE
The physical boundary of the TOE is the entire HCD product. Options and add-ons that
are not security relevant, such as finishers, do not need to be included in the TOE. If it is
possible for users to connect personal storage devices (such as portable flash memory
devices) to the HCD, those devices and data contained within them are out of scope of
the TOE and interfaces to connect such devices should be disabled.

The logical boundary of the TOE includes all security functions related to the Required
Uses of the HCD as described in <<USE CASE 1: Required Use Cases>>, all Conditionally Mandatory Uses as
described in <<USE CASE 2: Conditionally Mandatory Use Cases>> that are present in the HCD, and all Optional Uses as
described in <<USE CASE 3: Optional Use Cases>> that are to be included in the evaluation.


==== Operational Environment
For the purposes of this cPP, HCDs are used in an office environment by commercial,
government, or other organizations, and are connected to a wired LAN. If a PSTN fax
function is present, then the HCD can also be connected to the PSTN for sending and
receiving PSTN faxes.

Users may interact with the HCD through a variety of interfaces:

• A Local User interacts with the HCD using its physical operator console
• A Network User uses interacts with the HCD using programs installed on personal computers or other IT devices external to the HCD which communicate with the HCD through the LAN. This includes the use of general client programs such as web browsers and specific programs such as print or scan drivers.

The HCD and External IT Entities may also interact independently of human User input.

The Operational Environment is assumed to be physically and logically protected from Threats originating from outside of that environment, typically by limiting physical access to the HCD and connecting it to a LAN that is protected from the public Internet.


=== TOE Use Case

==== USE CASE 1: Required Use Cases
The security-relevant use cases for Required Uses of a conforming HCD are:

. One or more of the following:
.. Printing: A Network User sends a Document from an External IT Entity to the HCD over a LAN with instructions for printing. The HCD has the capability to protect the User’s Document from unauthorized disclosure or alteration while it is in transit to the HCD, in Temporary Storage in the HCD, and before printed output is released to a User.
.. Scanning: A Local User initiates scanning a Document on the HCD and the HCD sends the digital image to an External IT Entity. The HCD has the capability to protect the User’s Document from unauthorized disclosure or alteration while it is in Temporary Storage in the HCD and while it is in transit to the External IT Entity.
.. Copying: A Local User scans a Document on the HCD and the HCD prints the Document. The HCD has the capability to protect the User’s Document from unauthorized disclosure and alteration while it is in Temporary Storage in the HCD.
. Configuration: A Local or Network User with administrative privileges configures the security settings of the HCD. The HCD has the capability to assign Users to roles that distinguish Users who can perform administrative functions from Users who can perform User functions. The HCD also has the capability to protect its security settings from unauthorized disclosure and alteration when they are stored in the HCD and in transit to or from an External IT Entity.
. Auditing: Authorized personnel monitor security-relevant events in an audit log. The HCD generates audit log records when security-relevant events occur and stores them within the HCD. It is mandatory that the HCD is able to securely transmit audit logs to an External IT Entity for storage. The HCD has the capability to protect audit logs from unauthorized disclosure or alteration while in transit to the External IT Entity and, if stored in the HCD, then in storage.
. Verifying firmware/software updates: Authorized personnel install updated firmware/software on the HCD. The HCD ensures that only authorized personnel are permitted to install firmware/software, has the capability to help the installer to verify the authenticity of the firmware/software update.
. Verifying HCD function: The HCD checks itself for malfunctions by performing a self-test and verifying firmware/software integrity each time that it is powered on.

==== USE CASE 2: Conditionally Mandatory Use Cases
Conditionally Mandatory Uses are security-relevant capabilities that are optional in the HCD, however if they are present, must be conforming:

. Sending PSTN faxes: A Local User scans a Document on the HCD, or a Network User sends a Document from an External IT Entity to the HCD; the User provides instructions for sending it to a remote PSTN fax destination; the HCD sends a facsimile of the Document over the PSTN to the PSTN fax destination using standard PSTN fax protocols. The HCD has the capability to protect the Network User’s Document from unauthorized disclosure and alteration while in transit on the LAN. The HCD also has the capability to protect the User’s Document from unauthorized disclosure and alteration while in Temporary Storage in the HCD.
. Receiving PSTN faxes: A remote PSTN fax sender sends a facsimile of a Document over the PSTN to the HCD using standard PSTN fax protocols. The HCD has the capability to protect received PSTN faxes from unauthorized disclosure and alteration while it is present in the HCD. Further, the HCD has the capability to ensure that the PSTN fax modem is not used to access the LAN.
. Storing and retrieving Documents: A Local or Network User instructs the HCD to store or retrieve an electronic Document in the HCD. The sources and destinations of such Documents may be any of the other operations such as scanning, printing, or PSTN faxing. The HCD has the capability to protect such Documents from unauthorized disclosure and alteration while in transit and in storage in the HCD.
. Nonvolatile Storage Devices: Authorized personnel remove the HCD from service in its Operational Environment to perform preventative maintenance, repairs, or other servicing-related operations. The HCD has the capability to protect documents or confidential system information that may be present in Nonvolatile Storage Devices from exposure if such a device is removed from the HCD. The HCD also has the capability to destroy cryptographic key so that the encrypted data cannot subsequently be decrypted.

==== USE CASE 3: Optional Use Cases
Optional Uses are security-relevant capabilities that are optional in the HCD, and even if present in the HCD, are not required to be evaluated:

. Image Overwrite: At the conclusion of an image processing job, residual image data may be present in the HCD. The HCD has the capability to actively overwrite such image data.
. Wipe Data (e.g., Redeploying or Decommissioning the HCD): Authorized personnel remove the HCD from service in its Operational Environment to move it to a different Operational Environment, to permanently remove it from operation, or otherwise change its ownership. The HCD has the capability to make all customer data that may be present in the HCD unavailable for recovery if it is removed from the Operational Environment.




==== Major Security Functions of the HCD

To support the use cases in <<TOE Use Case>>, a conforming HCD provides the following
security functions:

1. Identification, authentication, and authorization to use HCD functions
2. Access control
3. Encryption
4. Trusted communications
5. Administrative roles
6. Auditing
7. Trusted operation
8. PSTN fax-network separation (if PSTN fax function is present)
9. Data clearing and purging (optional)

Each of these functions is described in the next subsections.

===== Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

User identification, authentication, and authorization ensure that functions of the HCD are accessible only to Users who have been authorized by an Administrator. User identification and authentication is also used as the basis for access control and administrative roles and helps associate security-relevant events and HCD use with specific Users. Identification and authentication may be performed by the HCD or by an external server.

===== Access Control

Access controls ensure that Documents, information related to Document Processing, and security-relevant data are accessible only to Users who have appropriate access permissions.

===== Data Encryption

Data encryption ensures that data assets cannot be accessed while in transit on the LAN.

By policy, data encryption is also used to protect documents and confidential system information on Nonvolatile Storage Devices to protect such data if such a device is removed from the HCD.

The effectiveness of data encryption is assured through the use of internationally accepted cryptographic algorithms.

===== Trusted Communications

Trusted communication paths are established to ensure that communications with the HCD are performed with known endpoints.

===== Administrative Roles

Role-based access controls ensure that the ability to configure the security settings of the HCD is available only to Users who have been authorized with an Administrator role.

===== Auditing

Audit logs are generated by the HCD to ensure that security-relevant events and HCD use can be monitored by authorized personnel. The HCD must generate audit logs and store them within the HCD as well as securely transmit them to an External IT entity for storage.

===== Trusted Operation

Firmware/Software updates to the HCD are verified to ensure the authenticity of the firmware/software before applying the update. The HCD performs self-tests to ensure that its operation is not disrupted by some detectable malfunctions.  The HCD performs hardware-anchored integrity verification of firmware/software at boot to ensure corrupted firmware/software is not executed.

===== PSTN Fax-Network Separation

If a conforming HCD has a PSTN fax function, PSTN fax-network separation ensures that the PSTN fax modem is not used to create a data bridge between the PSTN and the LAN.

===== Data Clearing and Purging

Optionally, an HCD may provide functions that actively overwrite image data, or that wipe/purge all customer-supplied information at the request of an authorized Administrator. These are discussed in <<appendix-optional>>.













== CC Conformance Claims
As defined by the references <<CC1>>, <<CC2>> and <<CC3>>, this cPP:

* conforms to the requirements of Common Criteria v3.1, Revision 5,
* is Part 2 extended,
* is Part 3 conformant,
* does not claim conformance to any other security functional requirement packages.

Conformance to this Protection Profile: To claim conformance to this Protection Profile, the conforming Security Target must comply with all of the following rules:

1. The TOE must support at least one of the Required Uses scanning, printing, or copying, and must support the Required Uses network communications and administration, described in <<USE CASE 1: Required Use Cases>>.

2. Security for all of those Required Uses supported by the TOE must be evaluated, conforming to the requirements of this Protection Profile.

3. If the TOE supports any of the Conditionally Mandatory Uses described in <<USE CASE 2: Conditionally Mandatory Use Cases>>, then that support must be evaluated conforming to the corresponding conditionally mandatory requirements described in <<Conditionally Mandatory Requirements>>.

4. The selected communications protocol(s) must be evaluated conforming to the corresponding selection-based protocol requirements in <<appendix-a-protected-communications>>.

5. The Security Target author may choose to include for evaluation any of the Optional Uses described in <<USE CASE 3: Optional Use Cases>>. The vendor may choose to evaluate those optional functions as described in <<appendix-optional>>.

6. The TOE must demonstrate Exact Conformance. Exact Conformance, as a subset of Strict Conformance as defined in <<CC1>>, Annex D.2, is defined as the ST meeting all of the previous conformance rules. While iteration is allowed, no additional requirements (from the CC parts 2 or 3) are allowed to be included in the ST.



== Security Problem Definition

The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address, assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is expected to enforce.


=== Users

A conforming TOE must define at least the following two User roles:

1. Normal Users [U.NORMAL] who are identified and authenticated and do not have an administrative role.
2. Administrators [U.ADMIN] who are identified and authenticated and have an administrative role.

A conforming TOE may allow additional roles, sub-roles, or groups. In particular, a conforming TOE may allow several administrative roles that have authority to administer different aspects of the TOE.

Note that a User can be a human user or an external IT entity. Also, a Normal User can be a Local User or a Network User as described in <<Operational Environment>>.

Additional details about Users are in <<User Definitions>>.

=== Assets

From a User’s perspective, the primary Asset to be protected in a TOE is User Document Data [D.USER.DOC]. A User’s job instructions, User Job Data [D.USER.JOB] (information related to a User’s Document or Document Processing Job), may also be protected if their compromise impacts the protection of User Document Data. Together, User Document Data and User Job Data are considered to be User Data.

As an illustrative example, data sent by a Network User for printing contains a User’s Document [D.USER.DOC] which must not be accessed by anyone else, and job instructions such as the destination to send scanned Documents [D.USER.JOB] which must not be altered by anyone else.

From an Administrator’s perspective, the primary Asset to be protected in a TOE is data that is used to configure and monitor the secure operation of the TOE. This kind of data is considered to be TOE Security Functionality (TSF) Data.

There are two broad categories for this kind of data:

1. Protected TSF Data, which may be read by any User but must be protected from
unauthorized modification and deletion [D.TSF.PROT]; and,

2. Confidential TSF Data, which may neither be read nor modified or deleted except by authorized Users [D.TSF.CONF].

Examples of assets requiring protection include transmitted communication data on the network (against unauthorized disclosure or modification), firmware and/or software in the HCD (against unauthorized modification or deletion), and audit records generated by the HCD (against unauthorized modification or deletion).

An illustrative example is data that is used by the TOE to identify and authenticate authorized Users. Typically, a username that is used for identification may be read by anyone but must be protected from unauthorized modification and deletion [D.TSF.PROT]. In contrast, a User’s password that is used for authentication must be confidential, prohibiting any Unauthorized Access [D.TSF.CONF].

If TSF Data is compromised, it can be used for a variety of malicious purposes that include elevation of privileges, accessing stored Documents, redirecting the destination of processed Documents, masquerading as an authorized User or Administrator, altering the operating firmware/software of the TOE, and attacking External IT Entities.

In a conforming TOE, TSF Data is clearly identified and categorized as either Protected TSF Data or Confidential TSF Data.

From a network security perspective, it is important to ensure the secure operation of the TOE and other IT entities in its Operational Environment. Since the Operational Environment is outside of the TOE, Organizational Security Policies are employed to address protection of the Operational Environment.

Additional details about assets are in <<Asset Definitions>>.














=== Threats

The following are Threats against the TOE that are countered by conforming products. Additional details about threats are in <<appendix-k-threat-def>>.

==== Unauthorized Access to User Data
An attacker may access (read, modify, or delete) User Document Data or change (modify or delete) User Job Data in the TOE through one of the TOE’s interfaces [T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS]. For example, depending on the design of the TOE, the attacker might access the printed output of a Network User’s print job, or modify the instructions for a job that is waiting in a queue, or read User Document Data that is in a User’s private or group storage area.

==== Unauthorized Access to TSF Data
An attacker may gain Unauthorized Access to TSF Data in the TOE through one of the TOE’s interfaces [T.TSF_COMPROMISE]. For example, depending on the design of the TOE, the attacker might use Unauthorized Access to TSF Data to elevate their own privileges, alter an Address Book to redirect output to a different destination, or use the TOE’s Credentials to gain access to an external server.

An attacker may cause the installation of unauthorized firmware/software on the TOE [T.UNAUTHORIZED_UPDATE]. For example, unauthorized firmware/software could be used to gain access to information that is processed by the TOE, or to attack other systems on the LAN.

==== Network Communication Attacks
An attacker may access data in transit or otherwise compromise the security of the TOE by monitoring or manipulating network communication [T.NET_COMPROMISE]. For example, here are several ways that network communications could be compromised: By monitoring clear-text communications on a wired LAN, the attacker might obtain User Document Data, User Credentials, or system Credentials, or hijack an interactive session. The attacker might record and replay a network communication session in order to log into the TOE as an authorized User to access Documents or as an authorized Administrator to change security settings. The attacker might masquerade as a trusted system on the LAN in order to receive outgoing scan jobs, to record the transmission of system Credentials, or to send malicious data to the TOE.

==== Malfunction
A malfunction of the TSF may cause loss of security if the TOE is permitted to operate while in a degraded state [T.TSF_FAILURE]. Hardware or firmware/software malfunctions can produce unpredictable results, with a possibility that security functions will not operate correctly.

==== Weak Cryptography
An unauthorized user or attacker that observes network traffic transmitted to and from the TOE may cryptographically exploit poorly chosen cryptographic algorithms, random bit generators, ciphers or key sizes [T.WEAK_CRYPTO].



=== Assumptions
The following assumptions must be upheld so that the objectives and requirements can effectively counter the threats described in this Protection Profile. Additional details about assumptions are in <<appendix-k-assumption-def>>.

==== Physical Security
Physical security, commensurate with the value of the TOE and the data it stores or processes, is assumed to be provided by the environment [A.PHYSICAL]. The TOE is assumed to be located in a physical environment that is controlled or monitored such that a physical attack is prevented or detected.

==== Network Security
The Operational Environment is assumed to protect the TOE from direct, public access to its LAN interface [A.NETWORK]. The TOE is not intended to withstand network-based attacks from an unmanaged network environment.

==== Administrator Trust
TOE Administrators are trusted to administer the TOE according to site security policies [A.TRUSTED_ADMIN]. It is the responsibility of the TOE Owner to only authorize administrators who are trusted to configure and operate the TOE according to site policies and to not use their privileges for malicious purposes.

==== User Training
Authorized Users are trained to use the TOE according to site security policies [A.TRAINED_USERS]. It is the responsibility of the TOE Owner to only authorize Users who are trained to use the TOE according to site policies.



=== Organizational Security Policies
The following are Organizational Security Policies  (OSPs) that are upheld by conforming products. Additional details about OSPs are in <<appendix-k-osp-def>>.

==== User Authorization
Users must be authorized before performing Document Processing and administrative functions [P.AUTHORIZATION]. Authorization allows the TOE Owner to control who is able to use the resources of the TOE and who is permitted to perform administrative functions.

==== Auditing
Security-relevant activities must be audited and the log of such actions must be stored within the TOE as well as protected and transmitted to an External IT Entity [P.AUDIT]. Stored internally as well as on an External IT Entity, an audit trail makes it possible for authorized personnel to review and identify suspicious activities and to account for TOE use as may be required by site policy or regulations.

==== Protected Communications
The TOE must be able to identify itself to other devices on the LAN [P.COMMS_PROTECTION]. Assuring identification helps prevent an attacker from masquerading as the TOE in order to receive incoming print jobs, recording the transmission of User Credentials, or sending malicious data to External IT Entities.

==== Storage Encryption
If the TOE stores User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data on Nonvolatile Storage Devices, it will encrypt such data on those devices and the TOE shall provide a function that an authorized administrator may destroy encryption keys or keying material when the TOE is removed from its Operational Environment or its ownership is changed [P.STORAGE_ENCRYPTION]. Data is assumed to be protected by the TSF when the TOE is operating in its Operational Environment. However, if Nonvolatile Storage Devices are removed from the TOE for Servicing, redeployment to another environment, or decommissioning, an attacker may be able to expose or modify User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data. Encrypting such data prevents the attacker from doing so without access to encryption keys or keying material.

Cleartext keys, submasks, random numbers, or any other values that contribute to the creation of encryption keys for Nonvolatile Storage of User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data must be protected from unauthorized access and must not be stored on any Nonvolatile Storage Device without protection [P.KEY_MATERIAL]. Unauthorized possession of key material in cleartext may allow an attacker to decrypt User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data.

==== PSTN Fax-Network Separation (conditionally mandatory)
If the TOE includes a PSTN fax function, it will ensure separation between the PSTN fax line and the LAN [P.FAX_FLOW]. The TOE is assumed to be in an Operational Environment that is protected, such as by an external firewall. However, the PSTN fax modem may be connected to a public switched telephone network. Ensuring separation of the PSTN fax and network prevents an attacker from using the PSTN fax modem to bypass the firewall or other external protection to access the protected environment.

==== Image Overwrite (optional)
Upon completion or cancellation of a Document Processing job, periodically, or when requested by an authorized administrator, residual image data in the TOE shall be made irretrievable from its Nonvolatile Storage Devices [P.IMAGE_OVERWRITE]. A customer may be concerned that image data that has been dereferenced by the TOE operating firmware/software may remain on Nonvolatile Storage Devices in the TOE after a Document Processing job has been completed or cancelled. Such customers desire that the image data be made unavailable by overwriting it with other data.

==== Wipe Data (optional)
The TOE shall provide a function that an authorized administrator can invoke to make all customer-supplied User Data and TSF Data permanently irretrievable from Nonvolatile Storage Devices [P.WIPE_DATA]. A customer may be concerned that data which is considered confidential in the Operational Environment may remain in Nonvolatile Storage Devices in the TOE after the TOE is permanently removed from its Operational Environment to be decommissioned from service or to be redeployed to a different Operational Environment. Such customers desire that all customer-supplied User Data and TSF Data be wiped/purged from the TOE so that it cannot be retrieved outside of the Operational Environment even if the data are encrypted and its cryptographic key is destroyed.

Note: Cryptographic erase which is covered in the mandatory requirement of FCS_CKM_EXT.4 and FCS_CKM.4 can be used as a method to remove some parts of User Data and TSF Data, but it cannot be a single method to remove User Data and TSF Data unless all the data are encrypted.

==== Root of Trust
The vendor provides a Root of Trust (RoT) that is comprised of the TOE firmware, hardware, and pre-installed public keys or required critical security parameters, free of intentionally malicious capabilities [P.ROT_INTEGRITY]. The platform trusts the RoT since it cannot verify the integrity and authenticity of
the RoT.

== Security Objectives

=== Security Objectives for the TOE

The following Security Objectives must be fulfilled by the TOE. Additional details about objectives for the TOE are in <<appendix-k-sec-obj-toe>> and <<appendix-k-sec-obj-op-env>>.

==== User Authorization
The TOE shall perform authorization of Users in accordance with security policies [O.USER_AUTHORIZATION].

This objective supports the policy that Users are authorized to administer the TOE or perform Document Processing functions that consume TOE resources. Users must be authorized to perform any of the Document Processing functions present in the TOE.

The mechanism for authorization is implemented within the TOE, and it may also depend on a trusted External IT Entity. If a conforming TOE supports more than one mechanism, then each should be evaluated as separate modes of operation.

In the case of printing (if that function is present in the TOE), User authorization may take place after the job has been submitted but must take place before printed output is made available to the User.

Users must be authorized to perform PSTN fax sending functions and document storage and retrieval functions, if such functions are provided by the conforming TOE.

Note that the TOE can receive a PSTN fax without any User authorization, but the received Document is subject to access controls.

==== User Identification and Authentication
The TOE shall perform identification and authentication of Users for operations that require access control, User authorization, or Administrator roles [O.USER_I&A].

The mechanism for identification and authentication (I&A) is implemented within the TOE, and it may also depend on a trusted External IT Entity (e.g., LDAP, Kerberos, or Active Directory). If a conforming TOE supports more than one mechanism, then each should be evaluated as separate modes of operation.

==== Access Control
The TOE shall enforce access controls to protect User Data and TSF Data in accordance with security policies [O.ACCESS_CONTROL].

The guiding principles for access control security policies in this cPP are:

. User Document Data [D.USER.DOC] can be accessed only by the Document owner or an Administrator.
. User Job Data [D.USER.JOB] can be read by any User but can be modified only by the Job Owner or an Administrator.
. Protected TSF Data [D.TSF.PROT] are data that can be read by any User but can be modified only by an Administrator or (in certain cases) a Normal User who is the owner of or otherwise associated with that data.
. Confidential TSF Data [D.TSF.CONF] are data that can only be accessed by an Administrator or (in certain cases) a Normal User who is the owner of or otherwise associated with that data.

The Security Target of a conforming TOE must clearly specify its access control policies for User Data and TSF Data.

==== Administrator Roles
The TOE shall ensure that only authorized Administrators are permitted to perform administrator functions [O.ADMIN_ROLES].

This objective addresses the need to have at least one Administrator role that is distinct from Normal Users. A conforming TOE may have specialized Administrator sub-roles, such as for device management, network management, or audit management.

==== Firmware/Software Update Verification
The TOE shall provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of firmware/software updates [O.UPDATE_VERIFICATION].

This objective addresses the concern that malicious firmware/software may be introduced into the TOE as a firmware/software update. Verifying authenticity, such as with a digital signature or published hash, is required. Access control by itself does not satisfy this objective.

==== Self-test
The TOE shall test some subset of its security functionality to help ensure that subset is operating properly [O.TSF_SELF_TEST].

A malfunction of the TOE may compromise its security if the malfunction is not detected and the TOE is allowed to operate. Self-test is intended to detect such malfunctions. It is performed during power-up.

==== Communications Protection
The TOE shall have the capability to protect LAN communications of User Data and TSF Data from Unauthorized Access, replay, and source/destination spoofing [O.COMMS_PROTECTION]. This objective addresses the common concerns of network communications:

. Sensitive data or Credentials are obtained by monitoring LAN data outside of the TOE.
. A successfully authenticated session is captured and replayed on the LAN, permitting the attacker to masquerade as the authenticated User.
. Sensitive data or Credentials are obtained by redirecting communications from the TOE or from an External IT Entity to a malevolent destination.

==== Auditing
The TOE shall generate audit data and store it internally as well as be capable of sending it to a trusted External IT Entity [O.AUDIT].

The TOE must store audit data internally with appropriate access controls to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, the TOE must be able to securely send audit data to a trusted External IT Entity (e.g., an audit server such as a syslog server).

==== Storage Encryption
If the TOE stores User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data in Nonvolatile Storage devices, then the TOE shall encrypt such data on those devices. [O.STORAGE_ENCRYPTION].

This objective addresses the concern that User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data on a Nonvolatile Storage Device may be exposed if the device is removed from the TOE, such as for Servicing, Redeployment to another environment, or Decommissioning.

==== Protection of Key Material
The TOE shall protect from unauthorized access any cleartext keys, submasks, random numbers, or other values that contribute to the creation of encryption keys for storage of User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data in Nonvolatile Storage Devices; The TOE shall ensure that such key material is not stored in cleartext on the storage device that uses that material [O.KEY_MATERIAL].

This objective addresses the concern that unauthorized possession of keys or key material may be used to decrypt User Document Data or Confidential TSF Data.

==== PSTN Fax-Network Separation (conditionally mandatory)
If the TOE provides a PSTN fax function, then the TOE shall ensure separation of the PSTN fax telephone line and the LAN, by system design or active security function [O.FAX_NET_SEPARATION].

This objective addresses customer concerns about having a telephone line connected to a device that is inside their firewall. Depending on implementation, it may be satisfied in different ways, such as by system architecture (no data path from the PSTN fax interface to the network interface), by system design (fax chipset recognizes only PSTN fax protocols), or by active security function (flow control).

==== Image Overwrite (optional)
Upon completion or cancellation of a Document Processing job, periodically, or when requested by an authorized administrator, the TOE shall overwrite residual image data from its Nonvolatile Storage Devices [O.IMAGE_OVERWRITE].  This objective addresses customer concerns that image data may remain on Nonvolatile Storage Devices in the TOE after a Document Processing job has been completed or cancelled.

==== Wipe Data (optional)
The TOE provides a function that an authorized administrator can invoke to make all customer-supplied User Data and TSF Data permanently irretrievable from Nonvolatile Storage Devices [O.WIPE_DATA]. This objective addresses customer concerns that data that is protected in the Operational Environment may remain in Nonvolatile Storage Devices after the TOE is permanently removed from its Operational Environment to be decommissioned from service or to be redeployed to a different Operational Environment.

==== Authentication Failures (conditionally mandatory)
The TOE resists repeated attempts to guess authorization data [O.AUTH_FAILURES] by responding to consecutive failed attempts in a way that prevents an attacker from exploring a significant amount of the space of possible authorization data values.

Note: This Security Objective needs to be Conditionally Mandatory based on the condition that the TOE has an internal authentication mechanism. Also, the HCD must ensure the HCD does not outlaw 3rd Party external authentication mechanisms.

==== Firmware Integrity
The TOE ensures its own integrity has remained intact [O.FW_INTEGRITY] and attests its integrity to outside parties on request.

==== Strong Cryptography
The TOE implements strong cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms according to recognized standards [O.STRONG_CRYPTO], including support for random bit generation based on recognized standards and a source of sufficient entropy. The TOE uses key sizes that are recognized as providing sufficient resistance to current attack capabilities.








=== Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

The following Security Objectives must be provided by the Operational Environment. Additional details about objectives for the Operational Environment are in <<appendix-k-sec-obj-op-env>>.

==== Physical Protection
The Operational Environment shall provide physical security, commensurate with the value of the TOE and the data it stores or processes [OE.PHYSICAL_PROTECTION].

Due to its intended function, this kind of TOE must be physically accessible to authorized Users, but it is not expected to be hardened against physical attacks. Therefore, the environment must provide an appropriate level of physical protection or monitoring to prevent physical attacks.

==== Network Protection
The Operational Environment shall provide network security to protect the TOE from direct, public access to its LAN interface [OE.NETWORK_PROTECTION].

This kind of TOE is not intended to be directly connected to a hostile network. Therefore, the environment must provide an appropriate level of network isolation.

==== Trusted Administrators
The TOE Owner shall establish trust that Administrators will not use their privileges for malicious purposes [OE.ADMIN_TRUST].

Administrators have privileges that can be misused for malicious purposes. It is the responsibility of the TOE Owner to grant administrator privileges only to individuals whom the TOE Owner trusts.

==== Trained Users
The TOE Owner shall ensure that Users are aware of site security policies and have the competence to follow them [OE.USER_TRAINING].

Site security depends on a combination of TOE security functions and appropriate use of those functions by Normal Users. Manufacturers may provide guidance to the TOE Owner regarding the TOE security functions that apply to Normal Users.

==== Trained Administrators
The TOE Owner shall ensure that Administrators are aware of site security policies and have the competence to use manufacturer’s guidance to correctly configure the TOE and protect passwords and keys accordingly [OE.ADMIN_TRAINING].

This kind of TOE may have many options for enabling and disabling security functions. Administrators must be able to understand and configure the TOE security functions to enforce site security policies.

_“Cryptographic Critical Security Parameters” are defined in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 as “security-related information (e.g., secret and private cryptographic keys, and authentication data such as passwords and PINs) whose disclosure or modification can compromise the security of a cryptographic module”._

_Keys, including intermediate keys and key material that are no longer needed are destroyed by using an approved method, FCS_CKM.4.1.   Examples of keys are intermediate keys, submasks, and BEV.  There may be instances where keys or key material that are contained in persistent storage are no longer needed and require destruction.  Based on their implementation, vendors will explain when certain keys are no longer needed.  There are multiple situations in which key material is no longer necessary, for example, a wrapped key may need to be destroyed when a password is changed.  However, there are instances when keys are allowed to remain in memory, for example, a device identification key._

*_Application Note:_*

_The ST Author chooses the algorithm(s) implemented to perform digital signatures. For the algorithm(s) chosen, the ST author makes the appropriate assignments/selections to specify the parameters that are implemented for that algorithm. The ST author ensures that the assignments and selections for this SFR include all the parameter values necessary for the cipher suites selected for the protocol SFRs (see <<appendix-a-protected-communications>>) that are included in the ST.

The documentation and tests required in the Evaluation Activity for this element should be repeated to cover each source indicated in the ST._

_ISO/IEC 18031:2011 contains three different methods of generating random numbers; each of these, in turn, depends on underlying cryptographic primitives (hash functions/ciphers). The ST author will select the function used and include the specific underlying cryptographic primitives used in the requirement. While any of the identified hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) are allowed for Hash_DRBG or HMAC_DRBG, any of the block ciphers-based (AES, SEED, HIGHT, LEA) implementations for CTR_DRBG are allowed._

_If the key length for the AES implementation used here is different than that used to encrypt the user data, then FCS_COP.1/DataEncryption may have to be adjusted or iterated to reflect the different key length.

*_Application Note:_*

_In general, the ST Author may modify this SFP provided that any changes are more restrictive. As examples, the ST Author may: remove the rules related to Document Processing functions that are not present in a TOE, add or modify rules to further deny access, or subdivide User Data to further restrict access for some data (e.g., D.USER.JOB.PROT and D.USER.JOB.CONF). Empty cells in the table indicate that the operation may be permitted, but it is not required to be permitted._

_In particular, referring to Table 4 and Table 5:_

- _A cell marked “Denied” indicates that the user (row) must not be permitted to perform the operation (column).  The ST Author cannot override this._
- _A cell that is blank indicates that the user may be permitted to perform the operation. However, the ST author may add conditions or restrictions, or deny permission entirely._
- _A cell that is marked with a Condition means that the user can be permitted to perform the operation, provided that it meets that Condition as specified below. As with blank cells, the ST author can make it more restrictive._

*_Condition 1_*: _Jobs submitted by unauthenticated users must contain a credential that the TOE can use to identify the Job Owner._

_See also the following Notes that are referenced in Table 4 and Table 5:_

*_Note 1_*: _Job Owner is identified by a credential or assigned to an authorized User as part of the process of submitting a print or storage Job._

*_Note 2_*: _Job Owner is assigned to an authorized User as part of the process of initiating a scan, copy, fax send, or retrieval Job._

*_Note 3_*: _Job Owner of received faxes is assigned by default or configuration. Minimally, ownership of received faxes is assigned to a specific user or U.ADMIN role._

*_Note 4_*: _PSTN faxes are received from outside of the TOE, they are not initiated by Users of the TOE._

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall contain one or more chains of trust with each chain of trust anchored in a Root of Trust that is implemented in immutable code or a HW-based write-protection mechanism.

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.2* At boot time the TSF shall use the chain(s) of trust to confirm integrity of its firmware/software using a [selection: _hash, digital signature, message authentication_] verification method.

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall [selection: _enter maintenance mode, halt boot process, reboot the device, [assignment: another behavior of TOE]_] in the event of a boot time verification failure so that the corrupted firmware/software isn't executed.

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.4* Following failure of verification, the TSF shall provide a mechanism to: [selection: _revert to previous TOE image, reinstall TOE image, perform a factory reset, indicate a need to contact vendor support_].

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.5* The TSF shall contain [selection: _hash data, digital signature data, message authentication code, public key for digital signature, symmetric key for message authentication with confidentiality protection as defined in FPT_SBT_EXT.1.6_] in the Hardware Root of Trust.

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.6* The TSF shall make the symmetric key accessible only to the Hardware Root of Trust





*_Application Note:_*

_The ‘contact vendor support’ may be selected to allow for the vendor to diagnose a failure in the verification carried out by the TOE at start-up. This selection provides a user of the TOE the option to involve the vendor in the resolution of a verification failure if performing the actions specified by any other selection does not change the state of the TOE._

======

*FPT_SKP_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall prevent reading of all pre-shared keys, symmetric keys, and private keys.

*_Application Note:_*

The intent of the requirement is that an administrator is unable to read or view the identified keys (stored or ephemeral) through “normal” interfaces. While it is understood that the administrator could directly read memory to view these keys, doing so is not a trivial task and may require substantial work on the part of an administrator. Since the administrator is considered a trusted agent, it is assumed they would not engage in such an activity.

*FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall provide authorized administrators the ability to initiate updates to TOE firmware/software.

*FPT_TUD_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall provide a means to verify firmware/software updates to the TOE using [selection: _digital signature, X.509 certificate_] and [selection: _published hash, no other functions_] prior to installing those updates.

*_Application Note:_*

FPT_TUD_EXT.1.2 may be interpreted to allow an administrator to “pre-authorize” automatic updates, provided that they are verified according to FPT_TUD_EXT.1.3.

The digital signature mechanism is specified in FCS_COP.1/SigGen. The published hash is generated by one of the functions specified in FCS_COP.1/Hash. It is acceptable to implement both mechanisms.

*FTP_ITC.1.1 Refinement:* The TSF shall *use [selection: _IPsec, SSH, TLS, DTLS, TLS/HTTPS_] to* provide *a trusted* communication channel between itself and *authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: remote audit server, [selection: _authentication server, [assignment: other capabilities]_]* that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data from *disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data*.

*FTP_ITC.1.2 Refinement:* The TSF shall permit [selection: _the TSF,_ *_or the authorized IT entities_*] to initiate communication via the trusted channel.

*FTP_ITC.1.3 Refinement:* The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for *remote audit* [assignment: *_and list of services for which the TSF is able to initiate communications_*].

*_Application Note:_*

_The assignment in FTP_ITC.1.3 should address the confidentiality and/or integrity requirements for communication of User and TSF Data between the TOE and another IT entity. FTP_TRP.1 is intended to be used for interactive communication between the TOE and remote users._

_The intent of the above requirement is to use a cryptographic protocol to protect external communications with authorized IT entities that the TOE interacts with to perform its functions. Protection (by one of the listed protocols) is required at least for communications with the server that collects the audit information. If it communicates with an authentication server (e.g., RADIUS), then the ST author chooses “authentication server” in FTP_ITC.1.1 and this connection must be protected by one of the listed protocols. If other authorized IT entities (e.g., NTP server) are protected, the ST author makes the appropriate assignments (for those entities) and selections (for the protocols that are used to protect those connections). After the ST author has made the selections, they are to select the detailed requirements in <<appendix-a-protected-communications>> corresponding to their protocol selection to put in the ST. To summarize, the connection to an external audit collection server is required to be protected by one of the listed protocols. If an External Authentication server is supported, then it is required to protect that connection with one of the listed protocols. For any other external server, external communications are not required to be protected, but if protection is claimed, then it must be protected with one of the identified protocols._

_While there are no requirements on the party initiating the communication, the ST author lists in the assignment for FTP_ITC.1.3 the services for which the TOE can initiate the communication with the authorized IT entity._

_The requirement implies that not only are communications protected when they are initially established, but also on resumption after an outage. It may be the case that some part of the TOE setup involves manually setting up tunnels to protect other communication, and if after an outage the TOE attempts to re-establish the communication automatically with (the necessary) manual intervention, there may be a window created where an attacker might be able to gain critical information or compromise a connection._

======

*FTP_TRP.1.1/Admin Refinement:* The TSF shall *use [selection, choose at least one of: _IPsec, SSH, TLS, DTLS, TLS/HTTPS_] to* provide *a trusted* communication path between itself and *remote administrators* that is logically distinct from other communication paths and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the communicated data from *disclosure and detection of modification of the communicated data*.

*FTP_TRP.1.2/Admin Refinement:* The TSF shall permit *remote administrators* to initiate communication via the trusted path

*FTP_TRP.1.3/Admin Refinement:* The TSF shall require the use of the trusted path for [*initial administrator authentication and all remote administration actions*].

*_Application Note:_*

_This requirement ensures that authorized remote administrators initiate all communication with the TOE via a trusted path, and that all communications with the TOE by remote administrators is performed over this path. The data passed in this trusted communication path are encrypted as defined the protocol chosen in the first selection. The ST author chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE, and then ensures the detailed requirements in <<appendix-a-protected-communications>> corresponding to their selection are copied to the ST if not already present._







== Security Assurance Requirements

The <<Security Objectives>> for the TOE were constructed to address <<threats>> identified in the <<Security Problem Definition>>. The <<Security Functional Requirements>> are a formal instantiation of the <<Security Objectives>>. This cPP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.

This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this cPP. Individual Evaluation Activities to be performed are specified in <<SD>>.

The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this cPP is as follows:

After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF (IT Security Evaluation Facility) will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT (if required), and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation Activities contained within the SD, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in the SD also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the cPP.

|===

=== ASE: Security Target

The ST is evaluated as per ASE activities defined in the <<CEM>>. In addition, there may be Evaluation Activities specified within the <<SD>> that call for necessary descriptions to be included in the TSS that are specific to the TOE technology type.

<<appendix-entropy>> provides a description of the information expected to be provided regarding the quality of entropy in the random bit generator.

Given the criticality of the key management scheme, this cPP requires the developer to provide a detailed description of their key management implementation. This information can be submitted as an appendix to the ST and marked proprietary, as this level of detailed information is not expected to be made publicly available. See <<appendix-kmd>> for details on the expectation of the developer’s Key Management Description.


=== ADV: Development
The design information about the TOE is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as well as the TSS portion of the ST, and any additional information required by this cPP that is not to be made public (e.g., Entropy Report).

==== Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)
The functional specification describes the TOE Security Functions Interfaces (TSFIs). It is not necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because TOEs conforming to this cPP will necessarily have interfaces to the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by TOE users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this cPP, the Evaluation Activities for this family focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation is necessary to satisfy the Evaluation Activities specified in <<SD>>.

The Evaluation Activities in <<SD>> are associated with the applicable SFRs; since these are directly associated with the SFRs, the tracing in element ADV_FSP.1.2D is implicitly already done and no additional documentation is necessary.

=== AGD: Guidance Documentation
The guidance documents will be provided with the ST. Guidance must include a description of how the IT personnel verifies that the Operational Environment can fulfill its role for the security functionality. The documentation should be in an informal style and readable by the IT personnel.

Guidance must be provided for every operational environment that the product supports as claimed in the ST. This guidance includes:

* instructions to successfully install the TSF in that environment; and
* instructions to manage the security of the TSF as a product and as a component of the larger operational environment; and
* instructions to provide a protected administrative capability.

Guidance pertaining to particular security functionality must also be provided; requirements on such guidance are contained in the Evaluation Activities specified in the <<SD>>.

==== Operational User Guidance (AGD_OPE.1)
The operational user guidance does not have to be contained in a single document. Guidance to users, administrators and application developers can be spread among documents or web pages.

The developer should review the Evaluation Activities contained in the <<SD>> to ascertain the specifics of the guidance that the evaluator will be checking for. This will provide the necessary information for the preparation of acceptable guidance.

==== Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)
As with the operational guidance, the developer should look to the Evaluation Activities to determine the required content with respect to preparative procedures.

=== Class ALC: Life-cycle Support
At the assurance level provided for TOEs conformant to this cPP, life-cycle support is limited to end-user-visible aspects of the life-cycle, rather than an examination of the TOE vendor’s development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the critical role that a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall trustworthiness of a product; rather, it is a reflection on the information to be made available for evaluation at this assurance level.

==== Labelling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)
This component is targeted at identifying the TOE such that it can be distinguished from other products or versions from the same vendor and can be easily specified when being procured by an end user.

==== TOE CM Coverage (ALC_CMS.1)
Given the scope of the TOE and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, the evaluator performs the CEM work units associated with ALC_CMC.1.

=== Class ATE: Tests
Testing is specified for functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family. For this cPP, testing is based on advertised functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the following requirements.

==== Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)
Testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the TSS as well as the operational guidance (includes “evaluated configuration” instructions). The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in Section 5 are being met. The Evaluation Activities in the SD identify the specific testing activities necessary to verify compliance with the SFRs. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/TOE combinations that are claiming conformance to this cPP.

=== Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment

For the first generation of this cPP, the iTC is expected to survey open sources to discover what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products and provide that content into the AVA_VAN discussion. In most cases, these vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. This information will be used in the development of future protection profiles.

==== Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)
<<SD>> provides a guide to the evaluator in performing a vulnerability analysis.

[id=appendix-selection-based]
[appendix]
== Selection-Based Requirements

=== Audit Events for Selection-Based SFRs
.Selection-Based Auditable Events
[%header,cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| *Relevant SFR* | *Auditable Event* | *Additional Information*
| FIA_X509_EXT.1 | Unsuccessful attempt to validate a certificate | Reason for failure of certificate validation
| FIA_X509_EXT.2 | None | None
| FIA_X509_EXT.3 | None | None
|===

*_Application Note:_*

_The audit event “Unsuccessful attempt to validate a certificate” for FIA_X509_EXT.1 requires the Additional Audit Record Contents of “Reason for failure (of certificate validation).” An error message telling the Security Administrator that ‘something is wrong with the certificate’ is not considered as presenting sufficient information about the ‘reason for failure’, because basic information to resolve the issue is missing from the audit record. The log message should inform the Security Administrator at least about the type of error (e.g., that there is a ‘Trust issue’ with the certificate, e.g., due to failed path validation, in contrast to the use of an ‘expired certificate’). The level of detail that needs to be provided to enable the Security Administrator to fix issues based on the information in audit events usually depends on the complexity of the underlying use case. In simple scenarios with only one underlying root cause a single error message might be sufficient whereas in more complex scenarios the granularity of error messages should be higher. The cPP only specifies a general guidance on the subject to avoid specifying requirements which are not implementation independent._

=== Protected Communications
As indicated in the FTP requirements, there are several methods by which conformant TOEs can mitigate threats against compromise of the communication channel between administrators, other portions of the TOE, or external IT entities. One of the secure communication protocols (IPsec, SSH, TLS, TLS/HTTPS) must be implemented in order to provide protected connectivity for (at a minimum) the audit server and remote administrators.

There are unique requirements associated with each of the protocol suites; these are specified in below. Depending on the selections for the FTP_ITC.1 and FTP_TRP.1 components, the ST author will need to include the associated SFRs and Assurance Activities in the ST.

*_Application Note:_*

_The TOE is required to use the IPsec protocol to establish connections used to communicate with an IPsec Peer._


*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall implement the IPsec architecture as specified in RFC 4301.

*_Application Note:_*

_RFC 4301 calls for an IPsec implementation to protect IP traffic through the use of a Security Policy Database (SPD). The SPD is used to define how IP packets are to be handled: PROTECT the packet (e.g., encrypt the packet), BYPASS the IPsec services (e.g., no encryption), or DISCARD the packet (e.g., drop the packet). The SPD can be implemented in various ways, including router access control lists, firewall rulesets, a ‘traditional’ SPD, etc. Regardless of the implementation details, there is a notion of a ‘rule’ that a packet is ‘matched’ against and a resulting action that takes place._

_While there must be a means to order the rules, a general approach to ordering is not mandated, as long as the SPD can distinguish the IP packets and apply the rules accordingly. There may be multiple SPDs (one for each network interface), but this is not required._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall have a nominal, final entry in the SPD that matches anything that is otherwise unmatched and discards it.

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall implement [selection: _transport mode, tunnel mode_].

*_Application Note:_*

_The ST author selects the supported modes of operation for IPsec._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.4* The TSF shall implement the IPsec protocol ESP as defined by RFC 4303 using the cryptographic algorithms [selection: _AES-CBC-128 (RFC 3602), AES-CBC-192 (RFC 3602), AES-CBC-256 (RFC 3602), AES-GCM-128 (RFC 4106), AES-GCM-192 (RFC 4106), AES-GCM-256 (RFC 4106)_] together with a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-based HMAC [selection: _HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, HMAC-SHA-512, no HMAC algorithm_].

*_Application Note:_*

_When an AES-CBC algorithm is selected, at least one SHA-based HMAC must also be chosen.
If only an AES-GCM algorithm is selected, then a SHA-based HMAC is not required since
AES-GCM satisfies both confidentiality and integrity functions. IPsec may utilise a truncated
version of the SHA-based HMAC functions contained in the selections. Where a truncated
output is utilised, it shall be highlighted in the TSS._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5* The TSF shall implement the protocol: [selection:

• _IKEv1 using Main Mode for Phase 1 exchanges, as defined in RFCs 2407, 2408, 2409, RFC 4109, [selection: no other RFCs for extended sequence numbers, RFC 4304 for extended sequence numbers], and [selection: no other RFCs for hash functions, RFC 4868 for hash functions]_;

• _IKEv2 as defined in RFC 5996 and [selection: with no support for NAT traversal, with mandatory support for NAT traversal as specified in RFC 5996, section 2.23)], and [selection: no other RFCs for hash functions, RFC 4868 for hash functions]_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_If the TOE implements SHA-2 hash algorithms for IKEv1 or IKEv2, the ST author selects RFC 4868. If the TOE implements the use of truncated SHA-based HMACs as described in RFC 4868, they shall be highlighted in the TSS._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.6* The TSF shall ensure the encrypted payload in the [selection: _IKEv1, IKEv2_] protocol uses the cryptographic algorithms [selection: _AES-CBC-128, AES-CBC-192, AES-CBC-256 (specified in RFC 3602), AES-GCM-128, AES-GCM-256 (specified in RFC 5282)_].

*_Application Note:_*

_AES-GCM-128, AES-GCM-192 and AES-GCM-256 may only be selected if IKEv2 is also selected, as there is no RFC defining AES-GCM for IKEv1._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.7* The TSF shall ensure that [selection:

• _IKEv1 Phase 1 SA lifetimes can be configured by a Security Administrator based on [selection:_
* _number of bytes;_
* _length of time, where the time values can be configured within [assignment: integer range including 24] hours; ];_

• _IKEv2 SA lifetimes can be configured by a Security Administrator based on [selection:_
* _number of bytes;_
* _length of time, where the time values can be configured within [assignment: integer range including 24] hours; ]_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_The ST author chooses either the IKEv1 requirements or IKEv2 requirements (or both, depending on the selection in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5). The ST author chooses either volume-based lifetimes or time-based lifetimes (or a combination). This requirement must be accomplished by providing Security Administrator-configurable lifetimes (with appropriate instructions in documents mandated by AGD_OPE). Hardcoded limits do not meet this requirement. In general, instructions for setting the parameters of the implementation, including lifetime of the SAs, should be included in the guidance documentation generated for AGD_OPE._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.8* The TSF shall ensure that [selection:

• _IKEv1 Phase 2 SA lifetimes can be configured by a Security Administrator based on [selection:_
* _number of bytes;_
* _length of time, where the time values can be configured within [assignment: integer range including 8] hours; ];_

• _IKEv2 Child SA lifetimes can be configured by a Security Administrator based on [selection:_
* _number of bytes;_
* _length of time, where the time values can be configured within [assignment: integer range including 8] hours; ]_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_The ST author chooses either the IKEv1 requirements or IKEv2 requirements (or both, depending on the selection in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.5). The ST author chooses either volume-based lifetimes or time-based lifetimes (or a combination). This requirement must be accomplished by providing Security Administrator-configurable lifetimes (with appropriate instructions in documents mandated by AGD_OPE). Hardcoded limits do not meet this requirement. In general, instructions for setting the parameters of the implementation, including lifetime of the SAs, should be included in the guidance documentation generated for AGD_OPE._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.9* The TSF shall generate the secret value x used in the IKE Diffie-Hellman key exchange (“x” in g^x mod p) using the random bit generator specified in FCS_RBG_EXT.1, and having a length of at least [assignment: _(one or more) number(s) of bits that is at least twice the security strength of the negotiated Diffie-Hellman group_] bits.

*_Application Note:_*

_For DH groups 19 and 20, the ‘x’ value is the point multiplier for the generator point G._

_Since the implementation may allow different Diffie-Hellman groups to be negotiated for use in forming the SAs, the assignment in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.9 may contain multiple values. For each DH group supported, the ST author consults Table 2 in NIST SP 800-57 “Recommendation for Key Management –Part 1: General” to determine the security strength (‘bits of security’) associated with the DH group. Each unique value is then used to fill in the assignment for this element. For example, suppose the implementation supports DH group 14 (2048-bit MODP) and group 20 (ECDH using NIST curve P-384). From Table 2, the bits of security value for group 14 is 112, and for group 20 is 192._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.10* The TSF shall generate nonces used in [selection: _IKEv1, IKEv2_] exchanges of length [selection:

• _according to the security strength associated with the negotiated Diffie-Hellman group;_

• _at least 128 bits in size and at least half the output size of the negotiated pseudorandom function (PRF) hash_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_The ST author must select the second option for nonce lengths if IKEv2 is also selected (as this is mandated in RFC 5996). The ST author may select either option for IKEv1._

_For the first option for nonce lengths, since the implementation may allow different Diffie-Hellman groups to be negotiated for use in forming the SAs, the assignment in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.10 may contain multiple values. For each DH group supported, the ST author consults Table 2 in NIST SP 800-57 “Recommendation for Key Management –Part 1: General” to determine the security strength (“bits of security”) associated with the DH group. Each unique value is then used to fill in the assignment for this element. For example, suppose the implementation supports DH group 14 (2048-bit MODP) and group 20 (ECDH using NIST curve P-384). From Table 2, the bits of security value for group 14 is 112, and for group 20 it is 192._

_Because nonces may be exchanged before the DH group is negotiated, the nonce used should be large enough to support all TOE-chosen proposals in the exchange._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.11* The TSF shall ensure that IKE protocols implement DH Group(s) [selection:

• _[selection: 14 (2048-bit MODP), 15 (3072-bit MODP), 16 (4096-bit MODP), 17 (6144-bit MODP), 18 (8192-bit MODP)] according to RFC 3526,_

• _[selection: 19 (256-bit Random ECP), 20 (384-bit Random ECP), 21 (521-bit Random ECP), 24 (2048-bit MODP with 256-bit POS)] according to RFC 5114._

].

*_Application Note:_*

_The selections are used to specify additional DH groups supported. This applies to IKEv1 and IKEv2 exchanges._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.12* The TSF shall be able to ensure by default that the strength of the symmetric algorithm (in terms of the number of bits in the key) negotiated to protect the [selection: _IKEv1 Phase 1, IKEv2 IKE_SA_] connection is greater than or equal to the strength of the symmetric algorithm (in terms of the number of bits in the key) negotiated to protect the [selection: _IKEv1 Phase 2, IKEv2 CHILD_SA_] connection.

*_Application Note:_*

_The ST author chooses either or both of the IKE selections based on what is implemented by the TOE. Obviously, the IKE version(s) chosen should be consistent not only in this element, but with other choices for other elements in this component. While it is acceptable for this capability to be configurable, the default configuration in the evaluated configuration (either ‘out of the box’ or by configuration guidance in the AGD documentation) must enable this functionality._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.13* The TSF shall ensure that all IKE protocols perform peer authentication using [selection: _RSA, ECDSA_] that use X.509v3 certificates that conform to RFC 4945 and [selection: _Pre-shared Keys, no other method_].

*_Application Note:_*

_At least one public-key-based Peer Authentication method is required in order to conform to this cPP; one or more of the public key schemes is chosen by the ST author to reflect what is implemented. The ST author also ensures that appropriate FCS requirements reflecting the algorithms used (and key generation capabilities, if provided) are listed to support those methods. Note that the TSS will elaborate on the way in which these algorithms are to be used (for example, RFC 2409 specifies three authentication methods using public keys; each one supported will be described in the TSS)._

*FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.14* The TSF shall only establish a trusted channel if the presented identifier in the received certificate matches the configured reference identifier, where the presented and reference identifiers are of the following fields and types: [selection: _SAN: IP address, SAN: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), SAN: user FQDN, CN: IP address, CN: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), CN: user FQDN, Distinguished Name (DN)_] and [selection: _no other reference identifier type, [assignment: other supported reference identifier types_]].

*_Application Note:_*

_When using RSA or ECDSA certificates for peer authentication, the reference and presented identifiers take the form of either a DN, IP address, FQDN or user FQDN. The reference identifier is the identifier the TOE expects to receive from the peer during IKE authentication. The presented identifier is the identifier that is contained within the peer certificate body. The ST author shall select the presented and reference identifier types supported and may optionally assign additional supported identifier types in the second selection. Excluding the DN identifier type (which is necessarily the Subject DN in the peer certificate), the TOE may support the identifier in either the Common Name or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or both._

_The critical requirement of X.509 identifiers is the ability to bind the public key uniquely to an identity. This can be achieved by using strongly-typed identifiers or controlling the CA and certificate issuance. One recommended method for identity verification is supporting the use of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. However, the support for a SAN extension is optional as long as identifier uniqueness can be achieved by other means._

_In a future version of this cPP, SAN and/or DN support might be required for all TOEs, support for CN might be optional, and the “other supported referenced identifier types” selection might be removed. In a future version of this cPP, it might also be required that the SAN (when present) shall take precedence over CN._

_Supported peer certificate algorithms are the same as FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.13_




[id=selection-tls]
==== FCS_TLSC_EXT & FCS_TLSS_EXT TLS Protocol

TLS is not a required component of this cPP. If a TOE implements TLS, a corresponding selection in FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, and/or FTP_TRP.1/NonAdmin should be made to define what the TLS protocol is implemented to protect. If a corresponding option to support TLS has been selected in at least one of the SFRs named above, the corresponding selection-based TLS-related SFRs should be added to the ST from <<selection-tls>> (i.e. FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 and/or FCS_TLSS_EXT.1).

The support for mutual authentication is optional when using TLS. If a TOE implements TLS with mutual authentication the corresponding optional SFRs should be added to the ST from chap. <<optional-tls>> (i.e. FCS_TLSC_EXT.2 and/or FCS_TLSS_EXT.2) in addition to the corresponding SFRs from <<selection-tls>>.

A TOE may act as the client, the server, or both in TLS sessions. The requirement has been separated into TLS Client (FCS_TLSC_EXT) and TLS Server (FCS_TLSS_EXT) requirements to allow for these differences. If the TOE acts as the client during the claimed TLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_TLSC_EXT requirements. If the TOE acts as the server during the claimed TLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_TLSS_EXT requirements. If the TOE acts as both a client and server during the claimed TLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_TLSC_EXT and FCS_TLSS_EXT requirements.

Additionally, TLS may or may not be performed with client authentication. The ST author shall claim FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 and/or FCS_TLSS_EXT.1 if the TOE does not support client authentication. The ST author should claim FCS_TLSC_EXT.2 and/or FCS_TLSS_EXT.2 if client authentication is performed by the TOE.

The following list contains all DTLS-/TLS-related ciphersuites supported by this cPP.

*FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall implement [selection: _TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246), TLS 1.1 (RFC 4346)_] and reject all other TLS and SSL versions.  The TLS implementation will support the following ciphersuites: [selection: _select supported ciphersuites from List 1_] and no other ciphersuites.

*_Application Note:_*

_The ciphersuites to be tested in the evaluated configuration are limited by this requirement and must be selected from the ciphersuites defined in List 1. The ST author should select the ciphersuites that are supported. Even though RFC 5246 mandates implementation of specific ciphers, there is no requirement to implement TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA in order to claim conformance to this cPP._

_These requirements will be revisited as new TLS versions are standardized by the IETF._

_In a future version of this cPP TLS v1.2 will be required for all TOEs._

*FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall verify that the presented identifier matches [selection: _the reference identifier per RFC 6125 section 6, IPv4 address in CN or SAN, IPv6 address in the CN or SAN, IPv4 address in SAN, IPv6 address in the SAN_].

*_Application Note:_*

_Where TLS is used for connections to/from non-TOE entities (relevant to FTP_ITC and FTP_TRP), the ST author shall select RFC 6125. The ST author selects “the reference identifier per RFC 6125 section 6” for TOEs that support FQDN, SRV, and URI identifiers._

_The ST author selects “IPv4…” and/or “IPv6…” based on the IP versions the TOE supports. The ST author selects “CN or SAN” when IP addresses are supported in the “CN” or “SAN” when the TOE mandates the presence of the SAN. When “CN or SAN” is selected, the TOE only checks the CN when the certificate does not contain the SAN extension._

_The rules for verification of identity are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125. Additionally, IP address identifiers may be supported in the SAN or CN. The reference identifier is established by the Administrator (e.g. entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of a mail server or authentication server), or by an application (e.g. a parameter of an API) depending on the application service. Based on a singular reference identifier’s source domain or IP address and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name, URI name, and Service Name for the Subject Alternative Name field. The client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the TLS server’s certificate._

_The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the Common Name may be supported for the purposes of backwards compatibility. When the SAN extension is present in a certificate, the CN must be ignored._

_Finally, the client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards and the TOE supports wildcard, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity.  The exception being, the use of wildcards is not supported when using IP address as the reference identifier_

*FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.3* When establishing a trusted channel, by default the TSF shall not establish a trusted channel if the server certificate is invalid. The TSF shall also [selection:

•	_Not implement any administrator override mechanism_
•	_require administrator authorization to establish the connection if the TSF fails to [selection: match the reference identifier, validate certificate path, validate expiration date, determine the revocation status] of the presented server certificate_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_‘Revocation status’ refers to an OCSP or CRL response that indicates the presented certificate is invalid. Inability to make a connection to determine validity shall be handled as specified in FIA_X509_EXT.2.2. If the revocation status of a certificate received by the TOE is ambiguous (e.g. ‘unknown’), this should be treated similar to the situation where no connection could be established to the revocation server and the option ‘determine the revocation status’ could be chosen for this._

_The purpose of the explicit selection in the SFR is to prevent the TOE providing an override mechanism for situations other than specified in the selection (e.g. one or more certificates in the certification path have been revoked and this status is known to the TOE)._

_If TLS is selected in FTP_ITC, then certificate validity is tested in accordance with testing performed for FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev._

*FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.4* The TSF shall [selection: _not present the Supported Elliptic Curves/Supported Groups Extension, present the Supported Elliptic Curves/Supported Groups Extension with the following curves/groups: [selection: secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1, ffdhe2048, ffdhe3072, ffdhe4096, ffdhe6144, ffdhe8192] and no other curves/groups_] in the Client Hello.

*_Application Note:_*

_If ciphersuites with elliptic curves were selected in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1, a selection of one or more curves is required. If no ciphersuites with elliptic curves were selected in FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1, then “not present the Support Elliptic Curves/Supported Groups Extension” should be selected._

_This requirement limits the elliptic curves allowed for authentication and key agreement to the NIST curves from FCS_COP.1/SigGen and FCS_CKM.1/AKG and FCS_CKM.2. This extension is required for clients supporting Elliptic Curve ciphersuites._

_If ciphersuites with DHE key agreement were selected FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1 and the TOE supports TLS FFC groups (e.g. ffdhe2048), this extension is required. This extension is not required if the TOE only supports non-TLS FFC groups (e.g. Group 14)._



===== FCS_TLSS_EXT.1 TLS Server Protocol Without Mutual Authentication

*FCS_TLSS_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall implement [selection: _TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246), TLS 1.1 (RFC 4346)_] and reject all other TLS and SSL versions.  The TLS implementation will support the following ciphersuites: [selection: _select supported ciphersuites from List 1_] and no other ciphersuites.

*_Application Note:_*

_The ciphersuites to be tested in the evaluated configuration are limited by this requirement and must be selected from the ciphersuites defined in List 1. The ST author should select the optional ciphersuites that are supported. Even though RFC 5246 mandates implementation of specific ciphers, there is no requirement to implement TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA in order to claim conformance to this cPP._

_These requirements will be revisited as new TLS versions are standardized by the IETF._

_In a future version of this cPP TLS v1.2 will be required for all TOEs._

==== FCS_SSHC_EXT & FCS_SSHS_EXT SSH Protocol

SSH is not a required component of this cPP. If a TOE implements SSH, a corresponding selection in FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, and/or FTP_TRP.1/NonAdmin should have been made that defines what the SSH protocol is implemented to protect.

A TOE may act as the client or the server in an SSH session. The requirement has been
separated into SSH Client (FCS_SSHC_EXT) and SSH Server (FCS_SSHS_EXT)
requirements to allow for these differences.

*_Application Note:_*

_The following mapping is provided as a guide to ST authors to ensure the appropriate RFC selections are made:_

- RFC 4256 – Select if keyboard-interactive authentication is available
- RFC 4344 – Select if AES-128-CTR or AES-256-CTR modes are available

- RFC 8308 Section 3.1 – Select if RFC 8332 is selected
- RFC 8332 – Select if SHA-2 is available with ssh-rsa selection for public key algorithms

_If the negotiated encryption algorithm is one of the aes*-gcm@openssh.com algorithms, then the MAC field is ignored during negotiation and implicitly selects AES-GCM for the MAC. However once negotiated the connection is conformant with RFC 5647 and this should be selected when using aes*-gcm@openssh.com algorithms. aes*-gcm@openssh.com is specified in Section 1.6 of the OpenSSH Protocol Specification (https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgibin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL?rev=1.31)._

_The ST author selects which of the additional RFCs to which conformance is being claimed. An SSH product can implement additional RFCs, but only those listed in the selection can be claimed as conformant under common criteria. The RFC selections for this requirement need to be consistent with selections in later elements of this Package (e.g., cryptographic algorithms permitted). RFC 4253 indicates that certain cryptographic algorithms are “REQUIRED”. This means that the implementation must include support, not that the algorithms must be enabled for use. Ensuring that algorithms indicated as “REQUIRED” but not listed in the later elements of this component are implemented is out of scope of the evaluation activity for this requirement._

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall ensure that the SSH protocol implementation supports the following user authentication methods as described in RFC 4252: public key-based, [selection: _password-based, no other method_].

*_Application Note:_*

_The intent of this element is to specify user authentication mechanism(s) that the TOE supports when acting as an SSH client. The TOE is required to implement the capability to generate user[1]based authentication keys in accordance with FCS_CKM.1 as specified by FMT_SMF.1 via “Ability to manage the cryptographic keys”. While no specific public key algorithms are mandatory to implement, the use of public key algorithms must be consistent with FCS_CKM.1, FCS_COP.1/Hash, and FCS_COP.1/SigGen._

_If the TOE implements password-based authentication, the option ‘password-based’ must be selected. If the TOE can only authenticate itself with a public key, the option ‘no other method’ must be chosen._



*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall ensure that, as described in RFC 4253, packets greater than [assignment: _number of bytes_] bytes in an SSH transport connection are dropped.

*_Application Note:_*

_RFC 4253 provides for the acceptance of ‘large packets’ with the caveat that the packets should be of ‘reasonable length’ or dropped. The assignment should be filled in by the ST author with the maximum packet size accepted, thus defining ‘reasonable length’ for the TOE._

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.4* The TSF shall ensure that the SSH transport implementation uses the following encryption algorithms and rejects all other encryption algorithms: [selection: _aes128-cbc, aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes256-ctr, AEAD_AES_128_GCM, AEAD_AES_256_GCM, aes128-gcm@openssh.com, aes256-gcm@openssh.com_].

_RFC 5647 specifies the use of the AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM algorithms in SSH. As described in RFC 5647, AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM can only be chosen as encryption algorithms when the same algorithm is being used as the MAC algorithm. Corresponding FCS_COP entries are included in the ST for the algorithms selected here._

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5* The TSF shall ensure that the SSH public-key based authentication implementation uses [selection: _ssh-rsa, rsa-sha2-256, rsa-sha2-512, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, x509v3-ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, x509v3-rsa2048-sha256_] as its public key algorithm(s) and rejects all other public key algorithms.

*_Application Note:_*

_The intent of this element is to specify peer (SSH server) authentication mechanism(s) that the TOE supports when acting as an SSH client. The TOE is required to implement the capability to verify the host’s public key as described in RFC 4251 Section 4.1._

_If x509v3-ssh-rsa, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, x509v3-ecdsasha2-nistp521 or x509v3-rsa2048-sha256 are selected, then the list of trusted certification authorities must be selected in FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.9 and the FIA_X509_EXT SFRs in <<appendix-selection-based>> are applicable._

_It is recommended to configure the TOE to reject presented RSA keys with a key length below 2048 bit. RFC 8332 specifies the use of rsa-sha2-256 or rsa-sha2-512 in SSH._

_Public-key or certificate-based client authentication within the SSH protocol is based on demonstrated possession of a private key matching a public key associated with a given authorized account on a system._

_If x509v3-based authentication is claimed, the ST shall also include the appropriate FIA_X509_EXT SFRs._

_SSH client implementations that claim to support x509v3-based public key authentication algorithms are expected to be able to parse server certificates that comply with RFC 6187 Section 4 recommendations._

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.6* The TSF shall ensure that the SSH transport implementation uses [selection: _hmac-sha1, hmac-sha1-96, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, AEAD_AES_128_GCM, AEAD_AES_256_GCM, implicit_] as its data integrity MAC algorithm(s) and rejects all other MAC algorithm(s).

*_Application Note:_*

_RFC 5647 specifies the use of the AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM algorithms in SSH. As described in RFC 5647, AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM can only be chosen as MAC algorithms when the same algorithm is
being used as the encryption algorithm. RFC 6668 specifies the use of the sha2 algorithms in SSH._

_The ST author selects “implicit” when, and only when, aes*-gcm@openssh.com is selected as an encryption algorithm. When aes*-gcm@openssh.com is negotiated as the encryption algorithm, the MAC algorithm field is ignored and GCM is implicitly used as the MAC. “implicit” is not an SSH algorithm identifier and will not be seen on the wire; however, the negotiated MAC might be decoded as “implicit”._

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.7* The TSF shall ensure that [selection: _diffie-hellman-group14-sha1, diffie-hellman-group15-sha512, ecdh-sha2-nistp256_] and [selection: _diffie-hellman-group14-sha256, diffie-hellman-group16-sha512, diffie-hellman-group17-sha512, diffie-hellmangroup18-sha512, ecdh-sha2-nistp384, ecdh-sha2-nistp521, no other methods_] are the only allowed key exchange methods used for the SSH protocol.

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.8* The TSF shall ensure that within SSH connections, the same session keys are used for a threshold of no longer than one hour, and each encryption key is used to protect no more than one gigabyte of data. After any of the thresholds are reached, a rekey needs to be performed.

*_Application Note:_*

_This SFR defines two thresholds - one for the maximum time span the same session keys can be used and the other one for the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted using the same session keys. Both thresholds need to be implemented and a rekey needs to be performed on whichever threshold is reached first. For the maximum transmitted data threshold, the encrypted traffic per encryption key needs to be counted. It is also acceptable to count the totally transmitted data per encryption key, the total encrypted traffic for incoming and outgoing data or the total transmitted incoming and outgoing data because the encrypted traffic per encryption key will always be lower or equal to the other options. The rekey requirement applies to all session keys (encryption, integrity protection) for incoming and outgoing traffic._

_It is acceptable for a TOE to implement lower thresholds than the maximum values defined in the SFR._

_For any configurable threshold related to this requirement the guidance documentation needs to specify how the threshold can be configured. The allowed values must either be specified in the guidance documentation and must be lower or equal to the thresholds specified in this SFR or the TOE must not accept values beyond the thresholds specified in this SFR._

*FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.9* The TSF shall ensure that the SSH client authenticates the identity of the SSH server using a local database associating each host name with its corresponding public key and [selection: _a list of trusted certification authorities, no other methods_] as described in RFC 4251 section 4.1.

*_Application Note:_*

_The list of trusted certification authorities can only be selected if x509v3 -ssh-rsa, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 or x509v3-rsa2048-sha256 are selected in FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5._

_The TOE must support pre-shared keys for use in the IPsec protocol. There are two types of pre-shared keys--text-based (which are required) and bit-based (which are optional)--supported by the TOE, as specified in the requirements below. The first type is referred to as “text-based pre-shared keys”, which refer to pre-shared keys that are entered by users as a string of characters from a standard character set, similar to a password.  Such pre-shared keys must be conditioned so that the string of characters is transformed into a string of bits, which is then used as the key._

_The second type is referred to as “bit-based pre-shared keys” (for lack of a standard term); this refers to keys that are either generated by the TSF on a command from the administrator, or input in "direct form" by an administrator.  "Direct form" means that the input is used directly as the key, with no "conditioning" as was the case for text-based pre-shared keys.  An example would be a string of hex digits that represent the bits that comprise the key._

_The requirements below mandate that the TOE must support text-based pre-shared keys and optionally support bit-based pre-shared keys, although generation of the bit-based pre-shared keys may be done either by the TOE or in the Operational Environment._

_For the length of the text-based pre-shared keys, a common length (22 characters) is required to help promote interoperability.  If other lengths are supported they should be listed in the assignment; this assignment can also specify a range of values (e.g., "lengths from 5 to 55 characters") as well._

_In the second selection for FIA_PSK_EXT.1.3, the ST author fills in the method by which the text string entered by the administrator is “conditioned” into the bit string used as the key.  This can be done by using one of the specified hash functions, or some other method through the assignment statement. If “bit-based pre-shared keys” is selected, the ST author specifies whether the TSF merely accepts bit-based pre-shared keys, or is capable of generating them.  If it generates them, the requirement specified that they must be generated using the RBG specified by the requirements.  If the use of bit-based pre-shared keys is not supported, the ST author chooses “use no other pre-shared keys”._

==== FCS_DTLSC_EXT & FCS_DTLSS_EXT DTLS Protocol

Datagram TLS (DTLS) is not a required component of the cPP. If a TOE implements DTLS, a corresponding selection in FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, and/or FTP_TRP.1/NonAdmin should be made to define what the DTLS protocol is implemented to protect. If a corresponding option to support DTLS has been selected in at least one of the SFRs named above, the corresponding selection-based DTLS-related SFRs should be added to the ST from <<selection-dtls>> (i.e. FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1 and/or FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1).

The support for mutual authentication is optional when using DTLS. If a TOE implements DTLS with mutual authentication the corresponding optional SFRs should be added to the ST from <<optional-dtls>> (i.e. FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2 and/or FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2) in addition to the corresponding SFRs from <<selection-dtls>>.

The decision whether to include the support for protocol-level mutual authentication in the scope of the evaluation is regarded as part of the TOE boundary definition. These SFRs can be included in a conforming ST at the discretion of the ST author, even if the conformance statement of the cPP requires exact conformance. It is not mandatory to implement mutually authenticated DTLS in order to conform to this cPP.

A TOE may act as the client, the server, or both in DTLS sessions. The requirement has been separated into DTLS Client (FCS_DTLSC_EXT) and DTLS Server (FCS_DTLSS_EXT) requirements to allow for these differences.

If the TOE acts as the client during the claimed DTLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_DTLSC_EXT requirements.

To ensure audit requirements are properly met, a DTLS receiver may need to monitor the DTLS connection state at the application layer. When no data is received from a DTLS connection for a long time (where the application decides what ‘long’ means), the receiver should send a close_notify alert message and close the connection.

If the TOE acts as the server during the claimed DTLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_DTLSS_EXT requirements. In this case the TOE needs to claim at least the FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1 requirements in <<selection-dtls>> (no support for mutual authentication). If the TOE acts as DTLS server and in addition also supports mutual authentication, the FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2 requirements in <<optional-tls>> need to be claimed in addition. If the TOE acts as both a client and server during the claimed DTLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_DTLSC_EXT and FCS_DTLSS_EXT requirements.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall implement [selection: _DTLS 1.2 (RFC 6347), DTLS 1.0 (RFC 4347)_] supporting the following ciphersuites: [selection: _select supported ciphersuites from List 1_] and no other ciphersuites.

*_Application Note:_*

_The ciphersuites to be tested in the evaluated configuration are limited by this requirement and must be selected from the ciphersuites defined in <<selection-tls>>. The ST author should select the ciphersuites that are supported. Even though RFC 5246 and RFC 6347 mandate implementation of specific ciphers, there is no requirement to implement TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA in order to claim conformance to this cPP._

_These requirements will be revisited as new DTLS versions are standardized by the IETF._

_In a future version of this cPP DTLS v1.2 will be required for all TOEs._

_FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1 should only be used if the TOE transmits application-layer data to an external entity using a trusted channel provided by DTLS without receiving application data that needs to be protected._

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall verify that the presented identifier matches [selection: _the reference identifier per RFC 6125 section 6, IPv4 address in CN or SAN, IPv6 address in the CN or SAN, IPv4 address in SAN, IPv6 address in the SAN_].

*_Application Note:_*

_Where DTLS is used for connections to or from non-TOE entities (relevant to FTP_ITC and FTP_TRP) the ST author shall select RFC 6125. The ST author selects “the reference identifier per RFC 6125 section 6” for TOEs that support FQDN, SRV, and URI identifiers._

_The ST author selects “IPv4…” and/or “IPv6…” based on the IP versions the TOE supports. The ST author selects “CN or SAN” when IP addresses are supported in the “CN” or “SAN” when the TOE mandates the presence of the SAN. When “CN or SAN” is selected, the TOE only checks the CN when the certificate does not contain the SAN extension._

_The rules for verification of identity are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125. Additionally, IP address identifiers may be supported in the SAN or CN. The reference identifier is established by the Administrator (e.g. entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of a mail server or authentication server), or by an application (e.g. a parameter of an API) depending on the application service. Based on a singular reference identifier’s source domain or IP address and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name, URI name, and Service Name for the Subject Alternative Name field. The client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the TLS server’s certificate._

_The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the Common Name may be supported for the purposes of backwards compatibility. When the SAN extension is present in a certificate, the CN must be ignored._

_Finally, the client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards and the TOE supports wildcard, the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity. The exception being, the use of wildcards is not supported when using IP address as the reference identifier._

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.3* When establishing a trusted channel, by default the TSF shall not establish a trusted channel if the server certificate is invalid. The TSF shall also [selection:

•	_Not implement any administrator override mechanism,_
•	_require administrator authorization to establish the connection if the TSF fails to [selection: match the reference identifier, validate certificate path, validate expiration date, determine the revocation status] of the presented server certificate_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_‘Revocation status’ refers to an OCSP or CRL response that indicates the presented certificate is invalid. Inability to make a connection to determine validity shall be handled as specified in FIA_X509_EXT.2.2. If the revocation status of a certificate received by the TOE is ambiguous (e.g. ‘unknown’), this should be treated similar to the situation where no connection could be established to the revocation server and the option ‘determine the revocation status’ could be chosen for this._

_The purpose of the explicit selection in the SFR is to prevent the TOE from providing an override mechanism for situations other than specified in the selection (e.g. one or more certificates in the certification path have been revoked and this status is known to the TOE)._

_If DTLS is selected in FTP_ITC then certificate validity is tested in accordance with testing performed for FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev._

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.4* The TSF shall [selection: _not present the Supported Elliptic Curves/Supported Groups Extension, present the Supported Elliptic Curves/Supported Groups Extension with the following curves/groups: [selection: secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1, ffdhe2048, ffdhe3072, ffdhe4096, ffdhe6144, ffdhe8192] and no other curves/groups_] in the Client Hello.

*_Application Note:_*

_If ciphersuites with elliptic curves were selected in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1, a selection of one or more curves is required. If no ciphersuites with elliptic curves were selected in FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1, then “not present the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension” should be selected._

_This requirement limits the elliptic curves allowed for authentication and key agreement to the NIST curves from FCS_COP.1/SigGen and FCS_CKM.1 and FCS_CKM.2. This extension is required for clients supporting Elliptic Curve ciphersuites._

_If ciphersuites with DHE key agreement were selected FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1 and the TOE supports TLS FFC groups (e.g. ffdhe2048), this extension is required. This extension is not required if the TOE only supports non-TLS FFC groups (e.g. Group 14)._



===== FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1 DTLS Server Protocol Without Mutual Authentication

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall implement [selection: _DTLS 1.2 (RFC 6347), DTLS 1.0 (RFC 4347)_] supporting the following ciphersuites: [selection: _select supported ciphersuites from List 1_] and no other ciphersuites.

*_Application Note:_*

_The ciphersuites to be tested in the evaluated configuration are limited by this requirement and must be selected from the ciphersuites defined in <<selection-tls>>. The ST author should select the ciphersuites that are supported. Even though RFC 5246 and RFC 6347 mandate implementation of specific ciphers, there is no requirement to implement TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA in order to claim conformance to this cPP._

_These requirements will be revisited as new DTLS versions are standardized by the IETF._

_In a future version of this cPP DTLS v1.2 will be required for all TOEs._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall deny connections from clients requesting _none_.

*_Application Note:_*

_This version of the cPP does not require the TOE to deny DTLS v1.0. In a future version of this cPP DTLS v1.0 will be required to be denied for all TOEs._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall not proceed with a connection handshake attempt if the DTLS Client fails validation.

*_Application Note:_*

_The process to validate the DTLS client is specified in section 4.2.1 of RFC 6347 (DTLS 1.2) and RFC 4347 (DTLS 1.0). The TOE validates the DTLS client during Connection Establishment (Handshaking) and prior to the TSF sending a Server Hello message. After receiving a ClientHello, the DTLS Server sends a HelloVerifyRequest along with a cookie. The cookie is a signed message using the keyed hash function specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyedHash. The DTLS Client then sends another ClientHello with the cookie attached. If the DTLS server successfully verifies the signed cookie, the Client is not using a spoofed IP address._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.4* The TSF shall perform key establishment for TLS using [selection: _RSA with key size [selection: 2048 bits, 3072 bits, 4096 bits], Diffie-Hellman parameters with size [selection: 2048 bits, 3072 bits, 4096 bits, 6144 bits, 8192 bits], Diffie-Hellman groups [selection: ffdhe2048, ffdhe3072, ffdhe4096, ffdhe6144, ffdhe8192, no other groups], ECDHE curves [selection: secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1] and no other curves_].

*_Application Note:_*

_The appropriate options shall be selected in the ST according to the key establishment options supported by the TOE. FMT_SMF.1 requires the configuration of the key agreement parameters to establish the security strength of the DTLS connection._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.5* The TSF shall [selection: _terminate the DTLS session, silently discard the record_] if a message received contains an invalid MAC.

*_Application Note:_*

_The Message Authentication Code (MAC) is negotiated during DTLS handshake phase and is used to protect integrity of messages received from the sender during DTLS data exchange. If MAC verification fails, the session must be terminated, or the record must be silently discarded._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.6* The TSF shall detect and silently discard replayed messages for:

•	DTLS records previously received.
•	DTLS records too old to fit in the sliding window.

*_Application Note:_*

_Replay Detection is described in section 4.1.2.6 of DTLS 1.2 (RFC 6347) and section 4.1.2.5 of DTLS 1.0 (RFC 4347). For each received record, the receiver verifies the record contains a sequence number that is within the sliding receive window and does not duplicate the sequence number of any other record received during the session.
"Silently Discard" means the TOE discards the packet without responding._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.7* The TSF shall support [selection: _no session resumption or session tickets, session resumption based on session IDs according to RFC 4346 (TLS1.1) or RFC 5246 (TLS1.2), session resumption based on session tickets according to RFC 5077_].

*_Application Note:_*

_If the TOE does not support session resumption or session tickets, select 'no session resumption or session tickets’. If the TOE supports session resumption based on session IDs according to RFC 4346 (TLS1.1) or RFC 5246 (TLS1.2), select 'session resumption based on session IDs according to RFC 4346 (TLS1.1) or RFC 5246 (TLS1.2)'. If the TOE supports session resumption based on session tickets according to RFC 5077, select 'session resumption based on session tickets according to RFC 5077'._

=== Identification and Authentication (FIA)

==== Authentication using X.509 certificates

X.509 certificate-based authentication is required if IPsec or TLS communications are claimed for FTP_ITC.1 or FTP_TRP. If SSH client communications are claimed and any x509 algorithms are claimed in FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5 or FCS_SSHS_EXT.1.5, these SFRs are required. In the case of the TOE only acting as the SSH server or acting as the client, but not claiming any x509 algorithms in FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5 or FCS_SSHS_EXT.1.5, these SFRs are optional.

Although the functionality in FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev and FIA_X509_EXT.2 is always required when using X.509 certificate-based authentication, the TOE only needs to be able to generate a Certification Request if the TOE needs to present an X.509 certificate to another endpoint via the TSF for authentication (i.e. if at least one of the following SFRs is included in the ST: FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2, FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1, FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2, FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1, FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5 (applicable only if at least one of the x509v3-* ciphers is selected), FCS_SSHS_EXT.1.5 (applicable only if at least one of the x509v3-* ciphers is selected), FCS_TLSC_EXT.2, FCS_TLSS_EXT.1, FCS_TLSS_EXT.2).. Therefore FIA_X509_EXT.3 only needs to be added to the ST in this case. If the TOE does not need to present an X.509 certificate to another endpoint via the TSF for authentication (e.g. a client not supporting mutual authentication) the use of FIA_X509_EXT.3 is optional.

(for O.COMMS_PROTECTION) +
*Hierarchical to:* +

*Dependencies:* +
	FIA_X509_EXT.2 X.509 Certificate Authentication
======

*FIA_X509_EXT.1.1/Rev Refinement* The TSF shall validate certificates in accordance with the following rules:

•	RFC 5280 certificate validation and certification path validation *supporting a minimum path length of three certificates.*
•	The certification path must terminate with a trusted CA certificate designated as a trust anchor.
•	The TSF shall validate a certification path by ensuring that all CA certificates in the certification path contain the basicConstraints extension with the CA flag set to TRUE.
•	The TSF shall validate the revocation status of the certificate using [selection: _the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) as specified in RFC 6960, a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) as specified in RFC 5280 Section 6.3, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) as specified in RFC 5759 Section 5_].
•	The TSF shall validate the extendedKeyUsage field according to the following rules:
======
	•	_Certificates used for trusted updates and executable code integrity verification shall have the Code Signing purpose (id-kp 3 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) in the extendedKeyUsage field._
	•	_Server certificates presented for TLS shall have the Server Authentication purpose (id-kp 1 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) in the extendedKeyUsage field._
	•	_Client certificates presented for TLS shall have the Client Authentication purpose (id-kp 2 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) in the extendedKeyUsage field._
	•	_OCSP certificates presented for OCSP responses shall have the OCSP Signing purpose (id-kp 9 with OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) in the extendedKeyUsage field._
======

*FIA_X509_EXT.1.2/Rev* The TSF shall only treat a certificate as a CA certificate if the basicConstraints extension is present and the CA flag is set to TRUE.

*_Application Note:_*

_FIA_X509_EXT.1.1/Rev lists the rules for validating certificates. The ST author selects whether revocation status is verified using OCSP or CRLs. The trusted channel/path protocols may require that certificates are used; this use may require that specific certificate extensions must be present and checked. If the TOE supports functionality that does not use any of the possible values listed in the specific certificate extension, then it is reasonable to process such certificate as the relevant part of the SFR is considered trivially satisfied. However, this does not mean that it is allowable to accept certificates with inappropriate extension values simply because a specific security function is not implemented by the TOE. For example, the TOE should not successfully authenticate a web server that presents an X.509v3 certificate that has extendedKeyUsage set to only OCSPSigning, even if the TOE does not implement OCSP revocation checking. The TOE shall be capable of supporting a minimum path length of three certificates. That is, the TOE shall support a hierarchy comprising of at least a self-signed root CA certificate, a subordinate CA certificate, and a leaf certificate. The chain validation is expected to terminate with a trust anchor. This means the validation can terminate with any trusted CA certificate designated as a trust anchor. This CA certificate must be loaded into the trust store ('certificate store', ' trusted CA Key Store' or similar) managed by the TOE trust store. If the TOE’s trust store supports loading of multiple hierarchical CA certificates or certificate chains, the TOE must clearly indicate all certificates that it considers trust anchors._

_The validation of X.509v3 leaf certificates comprises several steps:_

	a) A Certificate Revocation Check refers to the process of determining the current revocation status of an otherwise structurally valid certificate. This must be performed every time a certificate is used for authentication. This check must be performed for each certificate in the chain up to, but not including, the trust anchor. This means that CA certificates that are not trust anchors, and leaf certificates in the chain, must be checked. It is not required to check the revocation status of any CA certificate designated a trust anchor, however if such check is performed it must be handled consistently with how other certificates are checked.

	b) An expiration check must be performed. This check must be conducted for each certificate in the chain, up to and including the trust anchor.

	c) The continuity of the chain must be checked, showing that the signature on each certificate that is presented to the TOE is valid and the chain terminates at the trust anchor.

	d) The presence of relevant extensions in each certificate in the chain such as the extendedKeyUsage parameters of the leaf certificate must correspond to SFR-relevant functionality. For example, a peer acting as a web server should have TLS Web Server Authentication listed as an extendedKeyUsage parameter of its X.509v3 certificate. It shall be checked that the relevant extensions in each certificate in the chain such as the extendedKeyUsage parameters of the leaf certificate correspond to the SFR-relevant functionality they are used with.

_It is expected that revocation checking is performed when a certificate is used in an authentication step. It is expected that revocation checking is performed on both leaf and intermediate CA certificates when a leaf certificate is presented to the TOE as part of the certificate chain during authentication. Revocation checking of any CA certificate designated a trust anchor is not required._

_If the TOE implements mutual authentication or acts as a server, there is no expectation of performing any checks on TOE’s own leaf certificate during authentication._

*FIA_X509_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall use X.509v3 certificates as defined by RFC 5280 to support authentication for [selection: _DTLS, HTTPS, IPsec, TLS, SSH, [assignment: other protocols], no protocols_] and [selection: _code signing for system firmware/software updates [assignment: other uses], no additional uses_].

*FIA_X509_EXT.2.2* When the TSF cannot establish a connection to determine the validity of a certificate, the TSF shall [selection: _allow the Administrator to choose whether to accept the certificate in these cases, accept the certificate, not accept the certificate_].

*_Application Note:_*

_In FIA_X509_EXT.2.1, the ST author’s selection includes IPsec, TLS, or HTTPS if these protocols are included in FTP_ITC.1.1. SSH should be included if authentication other than ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, and/or ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 is selected in FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5 or FCS_SSHS_EXT.1.5. The ST author selects “code signing for system firmware/software updates” when “X.509 certificate” is selected in FPT_TUD_EXT.1.3._

_Often a connection must be established to check the revocation status of a certificate - either to download a CRL or to perform a lookup using OCSP. In FIA_X509_EXT.2.2 the selection is used to describe the behaviour in the event that such a connection cannot be established (for example, due to a network error). If the TOE has determined the certificate is valid according to all other rules in FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev, the behaviour indicated in the selection determines the validity. The TOE must not accept the certificate if it fails any of the other validation rules in FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev. If the Administrator-configured option is selected by the ST Author, the ST Author also selects the corresponding function in FMT_SMF.1. The selection should be consistent with the validation requirements in FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.14, FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.3 and FCS_TLSC_EXT.2.3._

_The ST author must include FIA_X509_EXT.2 in all instances except when only SSH is selected within FTP_ITC.1 and ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, and/or ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 authentication is also selected.

Although the functionality in FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev and FIA_X509_EXT.2 is always required when using X.509 certificate-based authentication, the TOE only needs to be able to generate a Certification Request if the TOE needs to present an X.509 certificate to another endpoint via the TSF for authentication (i.e. if at least one of the following SFRs is included in the ST: FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2, FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1, FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2, FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1, FCS_SSHC_EXT.1.5 (applicable only if at least one of the x509v3-* ciphers is selected), FCS_SSHS_EXT.1.5 (applicable only if at least one of the x509v3-* ciphers is selected), FCS_TLSC_EXT.2, FCS_TLSS_EXT.1, FCS_TLSS_EXT.2). Therefore FIA_X509_EXT.3 only needs to be added to the ST in this case. If the TOE does not need to present an X.509 certificate to another endpoint via the TSF for authentication (e.g. a client not supporting mutual authentication) the use of FIA_X509_EXT.3 is optional. This element must be included in the ST if X.509 certificates are used as part of FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, and/or FTP_TRP.1/NonAdmin where the TOE authenticating itself to external IT entities, administrators, or distributed components.

*FIA_X509_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall generate a Certificate Request as specified by RFC 2986 and be able to provide the following information in the request: public key and [selection: _device-specific information, Common Name, Organization, Organizational Unit, Country, [assignment: other information]_].

*_Application Note:_*

_The public key is the public key portion of the public-private key pair generated by the TOE as specified in FCS_CKM.1/AKG._

(for O.KEY_MATERIAL, for O.STRONG_CRYPTO) +
*Hierarchical to:* +
	No other components.

*Dependencies:* +
	FCS_KYC_EXT.1 Extended: Key Chaining
======

*FPT_KYP_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall [selection:

* _not store keys in non-volatile memory,_
* _only store keys in non-volatile memory when wrapped, as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, or encrypted, as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc or FCS_COP.1/KeyTransport,_
* _only store plaintext keys that meet any one of the following criteria [selection:_
** _the key is protected by another key that is not part of the key chain as specified in FCS_KYC_EXT.1,_
** _the key will no longer provide access to the encrypted data after initial provisioning,_
** _the key is a key split that is combined as specified in FCS_SMC_EXT.1, and the other half of the key split is [selection:_
*** _wrapped as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap,_
*** _encrypted as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc or FCS_COP.1/KeyTransport,_
*** _derived and not stored in non-volatile memory],_
** _the key is [selection: used to wrap a key as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, used to encrypt a key as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc or FCS_COP.1/KeyTransport] that is already [selection: wrapped as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, encrypted as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc or FCS_COP.1/KeyTransport],_

** _the non-volatile memory the key is stored on is located in a protected storage device_]

].

*_Application Note:_*

_The keys must be protected from unauthorized access and must not be stored on any nonvolatile storage device without protection. If the keys exist within protected memory that is not user accessible on the TOE or OE, the key can be used to protect the BEV or the DEK only if the key is:_

1. _a key that is protected by another key that is not a part of the key chain or;_
2. _a key split or provides additional layers of wrapping or encryption on keys that have already been protected or_
3. _the nonvolatile memory the key is stored on is located in a protected storage device and the key is protected from unauthorized access._

_The selection “the non-volatile memory the key is stored on is located in a protected storage device” and “the key is protected by another key that is not part of the key chain as specified in FCS_KYC_EXT.1” should be applied to the start (or root) of a key chain, not for intermediate of the key chain. If "the key is protected by another key that is not part of the key chain as specified in FCS_KYC_EXT.1" selection option is selected, vendors will need to explain what the other key is that is not in the key chain and how the “other key” is used to protect the key (for example, a public key used for encryption, keys only used within a protected storage device or separate coprocessor)._

_An example of another key that is not a part of the key chain is as follows. In a protected storage device or separate co-processor, if the key is generated, stored, used, protected from disclosure, and the key is not exportable as a plaintext key, then the key is considered as not belonging to the key chain._

_The protected storage device can protect stored data from unauthorized access and the nonvolatile memory in it is not accessible from outside of the TOE. Examples of protected storage devices include Secure Elements (SE), Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), Secure Enclave Processors (SEP), and so on._

_In the case where a encrypted key is stored on media that is decrypted by a key stored in a protected storage device, the selection for encrypting or wrapping a key that is already encrypted or wrapped should be used._

======

*_Application Note:_*

_This SFR forms a keychain that terminates either with a DEK or a BEV to unlock a self-encrypting drive. If passwords are not used, it can be a keychain of one, with no intermediate keys forming the DEK or BEV, provided that key is protected. For example, if the DEK for an SED is not stored on the SED and is released on power-up, a keychain of one is allowed._

*FCS_KYC_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall maintain a key chain of: [selection: _one, using a submask as the BEV or DEK; intermediate keys originating from one or more submask(s) to the BEV or DEK using the following method(s): [selection: key wrapping as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyWrap, key combining as specified in FCS_SMC_EXT.1, key encryption as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc, key derivation as specified in FCS_KDF_EXT.1, key transport as specified in FCS_COP.1/KeyTransport]] while maintaining an effective strength of [selection: 128 bits, 256 bits_].

*_Application Note:_*

_Key Chaining is the method of using multiple layers of encryption keys to ultimately secure the BEV (Border Encryption Value). The number of intermediate keys will vary – from one (e.g., taking the conditioned password authorization factor and directly using it as the BEV) to many. This applies to all keys that contribute to the ultimate wrapping or derivation of the BEV; including those in areas of protected storage (e.g. TPM stored keys, comparison values)._

_Multiple key chains to the BEV are allowed, as long as all chains meet the key chain requirement._

_Once the ST Author has selected a method to create the chain (either by unwrapping or encrypting keys), they pull the appropriate requirement out of this appendix. It is allowable for an implementation to use for any or all methods._

*_Application Note:_*

_If the self-encrypting device option is selected, the device must be certified in conformance to the current Full Disk Encryption Protection Profile. The ST Author should consult with a CC Scheme for advice on approved Protection Profiles._

*FDP_DSK_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall encrypt all protected data without user intervention.

*_Application Note:_*

_The intent of this requirement is to specify that encryption of any confidential data will not depend on a user electing to protect that data. The encryption specified in FDP_DSK_EXT.1 occurs transparently to the user and the decision to protect the data is outside the discretion of the user.  If additional data other than D.USER.DOC and D.TSF.CONF are encrypted, it will be wiped/purged by the cryptographic erase process._

_If a vendor makes the selection "use a self-encrypting Nonvolatile Storage Device that is separately CC certified to conform to the FDE EE cPP" in FDP_DSK_EXT.1.1, testing is not required as SED testing is performed within the FDE EE cPP already._

	FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1 Extended: HTTPS selected ].
======





*FTP_TRP.1.1/NonAdmin Refinement:* The TSF shall *use [selection, choose at least one of: _IPsec, SSH, TLS, DTLS, TLS/HTTPS_] to provide a trusted* communication path between itself and [remote] users that is logically distinct from other communication paths and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the communicated data from [disclosure *and detection of modification of the communicated data*].

*FTP_TRP.1.2/NonAdmin Refinement:* The TSF shall permit [selection: _the TSF, *+++<del>local users,</del>+++* remote users_] to initiate communication via the trusted path

*FTP_TRP.1.3/NonAdmin Refinement:* The TSF shall require the use of the trusted path for [*initial user authentication and all remote user actions*].

*_Application Note:_*

_This requirement ensures that authorized remote users initiate all communication with the TOE via a trusted path, and that all communications with the TOE by remote users is performed over this path. The data passed in this trusted communication path are encrypted as defined the protocol chosen in the first selection.

== Optional Requirements

ST authors are free to choose none, some or all SFRs defined in this chapter. Just the fact that a product supports a certain functionality does not mandate to add any SFR defined in this chapter.


=== Image Overwrite
The SFRs in this section are to be incorporated in the ST to support the optional Image Overwrite function.

==== FDP_UDU_EXT.1 Document Unavailability
======
(for O.IMAGE_OVERWRITE) +
*Hierarchical to:* +

FDP_UDU_EXT.1.1 The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content stored on a [selection: *_wear-leveled storage device_*, *_non-wear-leveled storage device_*] of a resource is made unavailable [selection: *_by overwriting data_*, *_by destroying its cryptographic key_*] upon the *deallocation of the resource from* the following objects: *D.USER.DOC*.

*_Application Note:_*

_The timing of overwriting or cryptographic key destruction is when completion or cancellation of a Document Processing job, periodically, or when requested by an authorized administrator. In the TSS the ST author will describe which timing is used._





=== Wipe Data
The SFRs in this section are to be incorporated in the ST to support the optional Wipe Data function.

(for O.WIPE_DATA) +
*Hierarchical to:* +
	No other components.

*Dependencies:* +
	No dependencies.
======

*FPT_WIPE_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall ensure that any previous customer-supplied information content of a resource in non-volatile storage is made unavailable upon the request of an Administrator to the following objects: [*D.USER, D.TSF*] using the following method(s): cryptographic erase and [selection:

* _logically addresses the storage location of the data and performs a [selection: single, [assignment: ST author defined multi-pass]] overwrite consisting of [selection: zeroes, ones, pseudo-random pattern, any value that does not contain any CSPs],_
* _block erase,_
* _media specific eMMC method,_
* _media specific ATA erase method,_
* _media specific NVMe method,_
* _no other method_

] that meets the following: [no standard].

*_Application Note:_*

_In this context, “cryptographic erase” encompasses any method that destroys the decryption key or the key that protects the decryption key while leaving encrypted D.USER and/or D.TSF on the storage media. This would include, for example, some ATA commands that only destroy the key. Note that key destruction is a mandatory requirement covered by FCS_CKM.4 and FCS_CKM_EXT.4. cryptographic erase also uses the method described in FCS_CKM.4 and FCS_CKM_EXT.4 for key destruction._

_Cryptographic erase covers D.USER.DOC and D.TSF.CONF (as per requirement of FDP_DSK_EXT.1). Encryption of additional data types is optional; therefore, cryptographic erase may not apply to additional data types._

_If the “overwrite” method is applied to any wear-leveling storage media, the ST author must assume that some encrypted D.USER and/or D.TSF remains on that storage media and document this condition in the TSS._

_If a single magnetic drive is partitioned, and one or more of the partitions do not contain D.USER or D.TSF, the ST author should clarify whether the partitions not containing the data are included in the wipe function._

_Wear-leveling storage media is characterized by differentiating between logical and internal physical addressing to enable longevity enhancements via erasures and re-writes being distributed across the physical media. The developer shall provide a debug log or special tooling to perform the evaluator's test._
















=== Cryptographic Support (FCS)

[id=optional-dtls]
==== FCS_DTLSC_EXT & FCS_DTLSS_EXT DTLS Protocol

Datagram TLS (DTLS) is not a required component of the HCDcPP. If a TOE implements DTLS, a corresponding selection in FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, and/or FTP_TRP.1/NonAdmin should be made to define what the DTLS protocol is implemented to protect. If a corresponding option to support DTLS has been selected in at least one of the SFRs named above, the corresponding selection-based DTLS-related SFRs should be added to the ST from chap. <<selection-dtls>> (i.e. FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1 and/or FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1).

The support for mutual authentication is optional when using DTLS. If a TOE implements DTLS with mutual authentication the corresponding optional SFRs should be added to the ST from <<optional-dtls>> (i.e. FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2 and/or FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2) in addition to the corresponding SFRs from <<selection-dtls>>.

A TOE may act as the client, the server, or both in DTLS sessions. The requirement has been separated into DTLS Client (FCS_DTLSC_EXT) and DTLS Server (FCS_DTLSS_EXT) requirements to allow for these differences.

If the TOE acts as the client during the claimed DTLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_DTLSC_EXT requirements.

To ensure audit requirements are properly met, a DTLS receiver may need to monitor the DTLS connection state at the application layer. When no data is received from a DTLS connection for a long time (where the application decides what "long" means), the receiver should send a close_notify alert message and close the connection.

If the TOE acts as the server during the claimed DTLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_DTLSS_EXT requirements. In this case the TOE needs to claim at least the FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1 requirements in <<selection-dtls>> (no support for mutual authentication). If the TOE acts as DTLS server and in addition also supports mutual authentication, the FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2 requirements in <<optional-dtls>> also need to be claimed in addition. If the TOE acts as both a client and server during the claimed TLS sessions, the ST author should claim the corresponding FCS_TLSC_EXT and FCS_TLSS_EXT requirements.

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall support mutual authentication using X.509v3 certificates.

*_Application Note:_*

_The use of X.509v3 certificates for DTLS is addressed in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. This requirement adds that the client must be capable of presenting a certificate to a DTLS server for DTLS mutual authentication._

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2.2* The TSF shall [selection: _terminate the DTLS session, silently discard the record_] if a message received contains an invalid MAC.

*_Application Note:_*

_The Message Authentication Code (MAC) is negotiated during the DTLS handshake phase and is used to protect the integrity of messages received from the sender during DTLS data exchange.  If MAC verification fails, the session must be terminated, or the record must be silently discarded._

*FCS_DTLSC_EXT.2.3* The TSF shall detect and silently discard replayed messages for:

•	DTLS records previously received.
•	DTLS records too old to fit in the sliding window.

*_Application Note:_*

_Replay Detection is described in section 4.1.2.6 of DTLS 1.2 (RFC 6347) and section 4.1.2.5 of DTLS 1.0 (RFC 4347).  For each received record, the receiver verifies the record contains a sequence number that is within the sliding receive window and does not duplicate the sequence number of any other record received during the session._

_"Silently Discard" means the TOE discards the packet without responding._


===== FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2 DTLS Server Support for Mutual Authentication

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall support mutual authentication of DTLS clients using X.509v3 certificates.

*_Application Note:_*

_The use of X.509v3 certificates for DTLS is addressed in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. This requirement adds that this use must include support for client-side certificates for DTLS mutual authentication._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2.2* When establishing a trusted channel, by default the TSF shall not establish a trusted channel if the client certificate is invalid. The TSF shall also [selection:

•	_Not implement any administrator override mechanism_
•	_require administrator authorization to establish the connection if the TSF fails to [selection: match the reference identifier, validate certificate path, validate expiration date, determine the revocation status] of the presented client certificate_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_‘Revocation status’ refers to an OCSP or CRL response that indicates the presented certificate is invalid. Inability to make a connection to determine validity shall be handled as specified in FIA_X509_EXT.2.2._

_If DTLS is selected in FTP_ITC, then certificate validity is tested in accordance with testing performed for FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev._

*FCS_DTLSS_EXT.2.3* The TSF shall not establish a trusted channel if the distinguished name (DN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) contained in a certificate does not match the expected identifier for the client.

*_Application Note:_*

_The client identifier may be in the Subject field or the Subject Alternative Name extension of the certificate. The expected identifier may either be configured, may be compared to the Domain Name, IP address, username, or email address used by the peer, or may be passed to a directory server for comparison._

[id=optional-tls]

TLS is not a required component of this cPP. If a TOE implements TLS, a corresponding selection in FTP_ITC.1, FTP_TRP.1/Admin, and/or FTP_TRP.1/NonAdmin should be made to define what the TLS protocol is implemented to protect. If a corresponding option to support TLS has been selected in at least one of the SFRs named above, the corresponding selection-based TLS related SFRs should be added to the ST from <<selection-tls>> (i.e. FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 and/or FCS_TLSS_EXT.1).

The support for mutual authentication is optional when using TLS. If a TOE implements TLS with mutual authentication, the corresponding optional SFRs should be added to the ST from <<optional-tls>> (i.e. FCS_TLSC_EXT.2 and/or FCS_TLSS_EXT.2) in addition to the corresponding SFRs from <<selection-tls>>.

*FCS_TLSC_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall support TLS communication with mutual authentication using X.509v3 certificates.

*_Application Note:_*

_The use of X.509v3 certificates for TLS is addressed in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. This requirement adds that the client must be capable of presenting a certificate to a TLS server for TLS mutual authentication._

===== FCS_TLSS_EXT.2 TLS Server Support for Mutual Authentication

*FCS_TLSS_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall support TLS communication with mutual authentication of TLS clients using X.509v3 certificates.

*_Application Note:_*

_The use of X.509v3 certificates for TLS is addressed in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. This requirement adds that the client must be capable of presenting a certificate to a TLS server for TLS mutual authentication._

*FCS_TLSS_EXT.2.2* When establishing a trusted channel, by default the TSF shall not establish a trusted channel if the client certificate is invalid. The TSF shall also [selection:

• _Not implement any administrator override mechanism,_
• _require administrator authorization to establish the connection if the TSF fails to [selection: match the reference identifier, validate certificate path, validate expiration date, determine the revocation status] of the presented client certificate_

].

*_Application Note:_*

_The use of X.509v3 certificates for TLS is addressed in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. This requirement adds that this use must include support for client-side certificates for TLS mutual authentication. If the revocation status of a certificate received by the TOE is unknown, this should be treated similar to the situation where no connection could be established to the revocation server and the option ‘determine the revocation status’ could be chosen for this. ‘Revocation status’ refers to an OCSP or CRL response that indicates the presented certificate is invalid. Inability to make a connection to determine validity shall be handled as specified in FIA_X509_EXT.2.2._

_The purpose of the explicit selection in the SFR is to prevent the TOE from providing an override mechanism for situations other than specified in the selection (e.g. one or more certificates in the certification path have been revoked and this status is known to the TOE). If TLS is selected in FTP_ITC, then certificate validity is tested in accordance with testing performed for FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev._

*FCS_TLSS_EXT.2.3* The TSF shall not establish a trusted channel if the identifier contained in a certificate does not match an expected identifier for the client. If the identifier is a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), then the TSF shall match the identifiers according to RFC 6125, otherwise the TSF shall parse the identifier from the certificate and match the identifier against the expected identifier of the client as described in the TSS.

*_Application Note:_*

_If the identifier is not a FQDN, then the TSS shall describe how the identifier is parsed from the certificate and matched._

_The client identifier may be in the Subject field or the Subject Alternative Name extension of the certificate. The expected identifier may either be configured, may be compared to the FQDN, IP address, username, or email address used by the client, or may be p assed to a directory server for comparison._

== Extended Component Definitions
This appendix contains the definitions for the extended requirements that are used in the cPP, including those used in <<Consistency Rationale>> and <<Selection-Based Requirements>> .

Note that several of the extended requirements used for this cPP have dependencies on SFRs that are iterated in the cPP (e.g. FCS_COP.1/DataEncryption). The reader is advised that the SFR names for these dependencies may differ if the same extended components are used in other Protection Profiles.

======

FAU_STG_EXT.1.1 The TSF shall be able to transmit the generated audit data to an External IT Entity using a trusted channel according to FTP_ITC.1.

*Rationale*

The TSF is required that the transmission of generated audit data to an External IT Entity which relies on a non-TOE audit server for storage and review of audit records. The storage of these audit records and the ability to allow the administrator to review these audit records is provided by the Operational Environment in that case. The Common Criteria does not provide a suitable SFR for the transmission of audit data to an External IT Entity.

This extended component protects the audit records, and it is therefore placed in the FAU class with a single component.

*Rationale*

Cryptographic Key Material Destruction is to ensure the keys and key materials that are no longer needed are destroyed by using an approved method, and the Common Criteria does not provide a suitable SFR for the Cryptographic Key Material Destruction.

This extended component protects the cryptographic key and key materials against exposure, and it is therefore placed in the FCS class with a single component.

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.4* Following failure of verification, the TSF shall provide a mechanism to: [selection: _revert to previous TOE image, reinstall TOE image, perform a factory reset, indicate a need to contact vendor support_].

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.5* The TSF shall contain [selection: _hash data, digital signature data, message authentication code, public key for digital signature, symmetric key for message authentication with confidentiality protection as defined in FPT_SBT_EXT.1.6_] in the Hardware Root of Trust.

*FPT_SBT_EXT.1.6* The TSF shall make the symmetric key accessible only to the Hardware Root of Trust.


*Rationale*

Secure Boot is to verify the integrity of the boot process starting with the hardware-anchored Root of Trust and then verifying each link in the corresponding Chain of Trust to ensure that no corrupted firmware/software is executed.

This extended component verifies the integrity of the Chains of Trusts which are TSF data, and it is therefore placed in the FPT class with a single component.

[id=appendix-entropy]
[appendix]
== Entropy Documentation and Assessment

=== Design Description
Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product.

The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating
where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described
in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.

This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.

If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.

=== Entropy Justification
There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.

The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.

For developer-provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output.

For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to
“assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.

Regardless of the type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.

The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.

=== Operating Conditions
The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included.

=== Health Testing
More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start up, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE behavior upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.


[id=appendix-kmd]
[appendix]
== Key Management Document

=== Key Management Description

The description will provide the following information for all keys in the key chain:

* The purpose of the key
* If the key is stored in non-volatile memory
* How and when the key is protected
* How and when the key is derived
* The strength of the key
* When or if the key would be no longer needed, along with a justification
* How and when the key may be shared
* Key destruction description

The description will also describe the following topics:

* A description of all authorization factors that are supported by the product and how each factor is handled, including any conditioning and combining performed.
* If validation is implemented, the process for validation shall be described, noting what value is used for validation and the process used to perform the validation. It shall describe how this process ensures no keys in the key chain are weakened or exposed by this process.
* The authorization process that leads to the decryption of the BEV or DEK. This section shall detail the key chain used by the product. It shall describe which keys are used in the protection of the BEV or DEK and how they meet the encryption or derivation requirements including the direct chain from the initial authorization to the BEV or DEK. It shall also include any values that add into that key chain or interact with the key chain and the protections that ensure those values do not weaken or expose the overall strength of the key chain.
* The diagram and essay will clearly illustrate the key hierarchy to ensure that at no point the chain could be broken without a cryptographic exhaust or all of the initial authorization values and the effective strength of the BEV or DEK is maintained throughout the key chain.
* A description of the data encryption engine, its components, and details about its implementation (e.g. initialization of the product, drivers, libraries (if applicable), logical interfaces for encryption/decryption, and how resources to be encrypted are identified). The description should also include the data flow from the device’s host interface to the device’s persistent media storing the data, information on those conditions in which the data bypasses the data encryption engine. The description should be detailed enough to verify all platforms ensure that when the user enables encryption, the product encrypts all selected resources.
* The process for destroying keys when they are no longer needed by describing the storage location of all keys and the protection of all keys stored in non-volatile memory.


=== Key Management Diagram:

* The diagram will include all keys from the initial authorization factor(s) to the BEV or DEK and any keys or values that contribute into the chain. It must list the cryptographic strength of each key and indicate how each key along the chain is protected with either options from key chaining requirement. The diagram should indicate the input used to derive or decrypt each key in the chain.
* A functional (block) diagram showing the main components (such as memories and processors) the initial steps needed for the activities the TOE performs to ensure it encrypts the targeted resources when a user or administrator first provisions the product.
