FDP_DSK_EXT.1 Protection of Data on Disk

// Provide the issue description extracted from the Issue that was generated for this problem, question, etc. that resulted in this TD being generated.
// Include the Issue Number
== Issue Description

The TSF can encrypt data within the scope of FDP_DSK_EXT.1 without the operation of TSFI. The tests for FDP_DSK_EXT.1 do not include the validation of data encryption in which data is encrypted without the operation of TSFI.

// Provide the resolution agreed upon by the HIT for this Issue
== Resolution

Add tests for FDP_DSK_EXT.1 for the case in which the TSF encrypts the data without the operation of TSFI.

// Provide here the specific change(s) by Document, Section number, paragraph and line that is to be made to the HCD cPP and/or HCD SD to resolve this issue

The SD is updated as follows (yellow highlights for additions, strikethrough for deletions) per section that is being updated:

*3.1.3.1. TSS*

#If any D.USER.DOC or D.TSF.CONF are transparently encrypted and written to disk via mechanisms other than operating TSFI, the evaluator shall verify that the TSS identifies those mechanisms and describes at a high level how the associated data are encrypted. The swap files and core dump may potentially contain D.USER.DOC or D.TSF.CONF should be considered.#

*3.1.3.4. Tests*

#Test 5. [Conditional: If any D.USER.DOC or D.TSF.CONF are transparently encrypted and written to disk via mechanisms other than operating TSFI] Using a special tooling that the developer shall provide, the evaluator shall write the known data to the storage through transparent encryption.#

#Test 6. [Conditional: If any D.USER.DOC or D.TSF.CONF are transparently encrypted and written to disk via mechanisms other than operating TSFI] Verify that the data written in Test 5 is not in plaintext form; and verify that the data can be decrypted by proper key and key material.#

#Test 5 and Test 6 should be performed for each mechanism not involving the operation of TSFIs described in the TSS.#


//Include a pointer to the file that contains the actual fix for this TD
