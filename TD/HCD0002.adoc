FPT_TST_EXT.1 TSF testing

// Provide the issue description extracted from the Issue that was generated for this problem, question, etc. that resulted in this TD being generated.
// Include the Issue Number
== Issue Description

The Tests assurance activity for FPT_TST_EXT.1 TSF testing lacks clarification and context to avoid overlap with the Tests assurance activity for FPT_SBT_EXT.1 Secure Boot and limit the scope to verifying the execution of self-tests. 

// Provide the resolution agreed upon by the HIT for this Issue
== Resolution

Update Tests assurance activity for FPT_TST_EXT.1 TSF testing to avoid overlap with the Tests assurance activity for FPT_SBT_EXT.1 Secure Boot and limit the scope to verifying the execution of self-tests.

Update FPT_TST_EXT.1.1 Application Note to make consistent. 

// Provide here the specific change(s) by Document, Section number, paragraph and line that is to be made to the HCD cPP and/or HCD SD to resolve this issue
== CPP_HCD_V1.0_supporting_doc

The SD is updated as follows (yellow highlights for additions, strikethrough for deletions) per section that is being updated:

*2.6.4.3. Tests*

+++<del>The evaluator with assistance from the vendor (if needed) shall confirm that when an error in the self-test results is induced into the TOE, the TOE no longer enters into operational mode. For example, DRGB self-test is a self-test function.</del>+++

#Although formal compliance is not mandated, the self-tests performed should aim for a level of confidence comparable to:#

* #[FIPS 140-2], chap. 4.9.1, Cryptographic algorithm test for the verification of the correct operation of cryptographic functions. 
Alternatively, national requirements of any CCRA member state for the security evaluation of cryptographic functions should be considered as appropriate.#

#The evaluator shall either verify that the self-tests described above are carried out during initial start-up or that the developer has justified any deviation from this.# 

== CPP_HCD_V1.0

The cPP is updated as follows (yellow highlights for additions, strikethrough for deletions) per section that is being updated:

*5.8.4. Application Note*

Power-on self-tests may take place before the TSF is operational+++<del>, in which case this SFR can be satisfied by verifying the TSF image by digital signature as specified in FCS_COP.1/SigGen, or by hash specified in FCS_COP.1/Hash</del>+++.

+++<del>Self-test is intended to detect malfunctions which may compromise the TSF. Since the integrity of the firmware/software is guaranteed by FPT_SBT_EXT, the function for FPT_TST_EXT should address the malfunction detection like DRBG self-test defined in ISO/IEC 18031:2011.</del>+++
